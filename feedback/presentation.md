# Presentation Feedback

See Canvas for grade.

* Good introduction
* Spoke too quickly
* Slides cluttered
* Clustering dendogram is too small to read -- what do you want us to see?
* Did you "implement" k-means or just use it? Choice of words is important
* k-means plot is well-designed
* Good results overall
