Relatively clear, concise introduction.

"we used the sub category" -- Subcategory of what? Of the Paradise Post? Some
other news outlet?

Details about data collection process generally belong in an appendix rather
than the main text of a scientific report, unless the details have some bearing
on how the data set is meant to be interpreted.

Did you try examining bigrams or trigrams? Does the form of tf-idf you used
account for differing document lengths?

What do the high-level hierarchical clusters seem to represent? For example,
what leads to the first split in the green clusters?

A more thorough investigation/discussion of what the clusters your methods
found appear to mean would've made the report stronger overall.

R1. Well-organized. Conclusions follow from evidence.

R2. For many of the clustering results, it seems like you did not follow
through with investigating the meaning of the clusters. Limited discussion of
how the results from the different clustering algorithms compare or fit
together to provide deeper insight.

F1. No major problems

F2. No major problems

C1. Clearly organized and labelled. Don't leave your API keys in your scripts
when you commit!
