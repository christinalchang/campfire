       " 'text': 'The morning of the Camp Fire, former Paradise resident Ashley Joyner was at home, watching over seven children ranging in age from 17 to just one year old. Two of the children were her own and five belonged to her friend, who she regularly helped by babysitting. “That morning, I went and dropped my kids off at the (school) bus stop. There was no sign of a fire,” Joyner said. “Finally the bus showed up, and not even 15-20 minutes later, I’m getting phone calls from the school, telling me I got to go pick up the kids.” Joyner said as soon as she stepped outside, “it looked like a volcano had erupted.” What happened next was similar to so many other stories from that terrible day, but Joyner’s story was — at least partially — captured by her emotional 911 call that morning. https://www.chicoer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/11-08-18-08.35.57-Phones-02-TEL-POS-2_Redacted.wav Joyner’s call was one of 266 calls recently released by Cal Fire, out of 1,300 total. However, she was one of the few callers to give her full name on that hectic and traumatic morning. “As soon as I heard it, I broke down, I started crying,” Joyner said. “I didn’t really remember what all I had said until I actually listened to the phone call, and it just brought everything back. I mean, the fear and just the emotions … it was just all crazy.” By 8:35 a.m., a spot fire had started on her property near Clark Road and the Skyway and the flames were growing rapidly. Joyner says she only had minutes to evacuate the seven children and herself into a single car that wouldn’t safely fit all of them. She called 911 as the fire spread on her property, and got the California Highway Patrol, who promptly transferred her to Cal Fire’s dispatch center in Oroville. “I was hollering for the oldest, his name was Zach,” Joyner recalled. “I was sitting outside trying to water it, to buy us a little time to get all the kids out of the house and into the car.” All seven children were in the car when the mother of the children she was taking care of showed up, Joyner said. “She was down in Oroville working, and I was on the phone with her throughout the whole morning telling her, ‘Hey you need to get up here.’” As soon as her friend arrived, Joyner said they had to leave. “There was no time to gather anything, and she was all, ‘Well I need this, I need that,’ and no, there was no time.” Joyner and her children escaped down the hill to Chico with nothing but the clothes on their backs, watching their house succumb to the fire as they drove away. The drive to safety down the hill would take a full eight hours. “My kids they were crying, scared, didn’t know what was going on,” Joyner said. “We looked behind us, and we saw our place go up in flames. We knew before Cal Fire told us. We knew beforehand that it was gone, because we watched it go up.” In the immediate aftermath of the fire, the family stayed in a motel for a few weeks, but eventually needed to find new housing and were faced with living in their car. “I came to a friend’s house, and I just broke down crying telling her, we’re going to end up living out of our car or in a tent,” Joyner said. “I was gonna sleep in my car or something and I was gonna have my kids stay with friends.” At the same time, Joyner’s husband lost his job after taking too much time off after the fire. So their friend took them in, at her own home in Oroville, and that’s where they’ve been ever since. But soon, she said, the family may consider a move to rural Wisconsin, where Joyner’s husband’s family lives. Her husband also found a new job, working as a forklift operator. “We’re looking, possibly. We want to wait until school is out; we want the kids to finish up,” she said.           Joyner said her daughter, who is 6, is doing OK, mostly concerned with the loss of her toys and not being able to see her friends. “Her number one thing is her friends that she left behind and (I tell her) ‘Honey, your friends are scattered everywhere right now,” Joyner said. “She wants to go home, and I keep telling her we can’t, we don’t have a home to go to.” Her son, who is 11, is having a rougher time of it. “We tried getting him into counseling through the school but he refuses to do it; he doesn’t want to talk about it. He doesn’t want to talk to nobody,” Joyner said. “He wakes up crying at night, and the doctor said he’s probably got a little bit of PTSD, which I kind of figured he did. The first week he woke up constantly looking out the windows, asking if the fire was coming.” For her own part, Joyner said hearing the 911 call brought back a flood of emotional memories. “I never thought I would ever hear it,” she said. “It brought back so much, so many emotions that I didn’t really know how to deal with it at the moment.” Joyner said she went outside and cried after hearing her panicked voice in the call from that morning. She said she tries hard not to be emotional, especially around her children. “I’ve been actually thinking about trying to find somebody that I can actually talk to,” Joyner said. “I don’t want them to see me break down.”',\n",

       "['PARADISE — Emotions and tempers ran high Monday morning as the Paradise Town Council held an open, emergency meeting before voting on a new ordinance that would make it illegal for Camp Fire survivors to live in recreational vehicles on property with burned debris. The decision comes a little more than a week after the town council and the Butte County Board of Supervisors were informed that the previously-passed ordinances that allowed residents to live in RVs more than 100 feet from debris could jeopardize the $1.7 billion in Federal Emergency Management Agency funding earmarked for debris removal. The new urgency ordinance, No. 575, replaces Urgency Ordinance No. 573, and changes who is allowed to be on property with burned debris before removal and when. Under Ordinance No. 573 passed in December, residents living in temporary housing — RVs and trailers — with a qualifying destroyed structure for debris removal would be able to live on the property up until the time of clean up, then leave during debris removal, and then be allowed to return. The new ordinance, No. 575, passed Monday, says no one living in temporary housing can live on property with a qualifying burned structure until the debris is removed — they can only return to their property with an RV or trailer after it’s certified clean. Paradise Town Manager Lauren Gill said she was hesitant to put a time stamp on it, but that cleanup and soil samples could take anywhere from several weeks to a few months to be completed. The issue at hand stems from a warning Butte County Health Officer Andy Miller made back in late November, warning that the fire debris area was unsafe to live near. The Paradise Town Council says it made the emergency ordinances with that knowledge, and the original urgency ordinance was given the OK by a FEMA representative. Less than two weeks ago, FEMA’s Federal Coordinating Officer David Samaniego told California Office of Emergency Services Acting Deputy Director Eric Lamoureux that if Paradise and Butte County allowed residents to reoccupy their property prior to fire debris and hazardous materials being removed, they would be contradicting the county’s own health officials. That contradiction could nullify the terms of FEMA’s reimbursement offer of $1.7 billion. Lamoureux, in turn, notified the town council and the board of supervisors, and both bodies immediately stopped issuing utility pull permits the next day. However, approximately 100 residents in Paradise, and about 30 in the unincorporated county area, had already been issued pull permits for their RVs and trailers before then. Town Manager Lauren Gill said they are hoping to have those 100-plus residents be the first to receive debris removal services, and the town is in the process of negotiating with the Paradise Alliance Church and with nearby state parks to house the RVs until that process is completed. “I hate making this decision,” said councilor Mike Zuccolillo, calling the situation “illogical and quite frankly, stupid.” “We’ve got to get our town cleaned up, and I feel like we have a financial gun to our head,” he said.           Tensions ran high at the podium too, as resident after resident took to the stand to voice concern, anger, frustration and sadness at yet another roadblock in front of their recovery — with many asking why a FEMA representative was not present to answer questions. More than 200 residents and concerned citizens were present, filling the small chambers and spilling out into the hall. Part of the confusion and frustration with FEMA’s requirement is that RVs are not allowed to be on hazardous properties until the property is cleaned, but residents with houses that survived can remain living there, in any proximity, while debris cleanup occurs. Additionally, residents with RVs may return once their property is cleaned, but the status of their neighbor’s property has no bearing — even if they are living closer to that debris than their own. “I’m asking you not to throw the people of this town into the cold in the middle of winter,” said resident Ben Walker. “If the option is to choose federal money to rebuild the town, or the people to rebuild the town — choose the people.” Several members of the audience demanded the right to speak after the official public comment period was over, and with the encouragement of councilor Steve Crowder, Paradise Mayor Jody Jones allowed additional time to hear from several more. One audience member was asked to leave toward the end as he shouted, “They don’t dictate us!” and “Make the right decision!” as he was escorted out. Each of the five council members seemed deeply conflicted and emotional about the vote, many spoke on the verge of tears and anger with the decision that was in front of them, but ultimately, the repeal and replacement ordinance passed unanimously. The Butte County Board of Supervisors meets at 3:30 p.m. today to discuss the same issue for the unincorporated parts of the burn area.',\n",
       " 'The Paradise Unified School District is going to put out a number of request for proposals for a number of different services, the trustees said in a meeting Tuesday morning. Those services, starting with an arborist, that will go check the condition of the trees and decide whether they need to be removed, according to PUSD legal counsel Emily LaMoe. There will be a request for proposal for a company to take down the trees LaMoe added. The school district is working with county representatives and other public agencies that are going through similar processes she noted. “You will be seeing contracts for these consultants and contractors as they come through,” she said. “We are looking at maybe an RFP for a consultant for assistance with FEMA procedures to make sure that we’re doing everything we need to ensure reimbursement for all eligible categories.” The requests for proposals will be going out in the next couple of weeks and then when the responses are received the school district then can make a final decision and approve a contract with those agencies she added. A question was posed by PUSD trustee Bill Sharrett about the timeline of the proposals. “Are we doing anything to try to accelerate that happening at the high school?” he said.” Are we going to have a graduation night?” LaMoe assured the district that the high school is the number one priority. The school district followed by adjourning the meeting and proceeded to session.',\n",

The show’s theme is about small town resilience. “Among the total devastation of the Camp Fire to our community, our beloved little playhouse still stands,” in a statement on Theatre on the Ridge’s website. “We’re not sure what the future holds, but we will be back up and running with the 2019 Season to provide much needed love and light for our community as Paradise rises anew from the ashes.” The building sustained the fire with smoke damage but the theater’s fencing was destroyed. “When we found out our building survived we wanted to show something special, we decided to use the format of Radioland, for the return of the theater and the return of our community,” Miller said. “That is what this first three week run of the show is about. This show returning to Paradise is our love letter to the Ridge.” The fencing is being put in and will be restored on opening night next Thursday according to Miller. Different theater groups outside the region heard about how the building survived and fundraised to replace the fencing. Out of the people that live on the Ridge, 80 percent of company members lost their homes he commented. Two weeks after the fire was the first time Camp Fire survivors saw each other in Chico at their production of High Noon at Chico Theater Company. “The emotion of seeing each other again meant a lot,” Miller said. (Reopening Theatre on the Ridge is) the first chance for everybody to come back to see each other, they can reconnect and that’s what we hope this show will do.” From night to night the artists that perform in the show will change. A core group of a dozen performers and surprise guest acts will entertain audiences in attendance. “We’ve had a group of town performers that are enthusiastic and excited to be apart of this love letter to Paradise,” Miller commented. Most of the actors are from the shows prior but some actors are new he noted. “We want to be one of the first things that brings the town to life and to show people that our community still exists,” Miller said. Radioland’s Returns to Paradise can be seen Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Feb. 14 through March 2 with curtain time at 7:30 p.m. Sunday matinees are shown Feb. 17, 24, and March 3 with curtain time at 2 p.m. Ticket prices are $16 for general seating, $20 for reserved. Tickets can be purchased at Chico ticket outlets inside the Vegabond Rose, located at 236 Main Street and at Hair, Body and Soul, located at 1600 Mangrove Avenue #135. Tickets can also be purchased online at  . Theatre on the Ridge is located at 3735 Neal Road.',\n",
       " 'Since the great (not in a good way) California wildfire on Nov.\\xa0 8 I’ve been living in a beautiful fifth wheel travel trailer which belongs to a dear friend. I’m not alone; Topper, my Toller and Jack the Cat live here with me, too. Some survivors are still in shelters and/or tents; there but for the grace of God go I. When I describe the “hardships” of living in the middle of nowhere it sounds as if I’m complaining; quite the contrary. Because I have nothing, I am eternally grateful and fully aware of how lucky I am to be a survivor. We are situated many miles outside Corning, in the middle of cattle country, surrounded by vast pastures. I’m adjusting to flatlands, Oak trees and big sky views. Coming from the Ridge, with its tall trees and deep canyons, I could only see the sky looking straight up; the big sky views here with ever changing cloud art and awesome sunsets are a wonderful trade off. Although our trailer is big, with four pop outs and nicely furnished, we’re parked basically in a field near a single wide mobile where my friend’s cousin lives. The only hookup we have is electric and cold water. No using the bathroom except for basic tooth brushing and washing hands. The bathroom I use is in the laundry room in the big barn across the barnyard. The kitchen is adequate with a microwave and toaster oven for cooking. The only heat is supplied by small electric heaters which pretty much cost an arm and leg. For that reason, I only heat the bedroom and the three of us; Tops, Jack and me, live there. The wonderful big bed takes up most of the room, but there’s a big closet and counter with storage drawers and a place for the big screen tv. Pictured is Jack and Tops on the bed where we all spend 90 percent of our time. Until now, I had no internet service for the laptop and could only get on line with the cellphone. Apparently we’re in a black hole out here as far as Wi-Fi goes and there’s no live TV. I pass the time streaming Netflix and Amazon Prime on the phone, connected to the TV or watch DVDs. Not having local news shows has made me feel really cutoff from the rest of the world. The happiest of the three us, with no doubt, is Topper dog. He is with me, on the bed, 24/7. He was never on the bed before, when we had a house, but here there’s no floor space for him. The property is perimeter fenced, but there are cats, chickens, Jack Rabbits, Quail and heaven knows what else within that perimeter that Tops would definitely chase, given the chance. For that reason, he can only go out with me on leash, until we get through the barnyard and down to the pasture where he can run free. Run he does! I usually take the ball so we can play a little bit, once he’s taken care of business. This means regular potty runs throughout the day and night, regardless of weather. Plus, to save my sanity and get us both a little exercise, we go for long walks. There’s a sizable stream not far from here; lately we’ve been walking two to three miles a day. The thing that truly amazes me about Topper and, indeed, all the Tollers (3) I’ve had is how absolutely calm they happily adjust to total indoor living. He gets silly and runs around like a hyperactive field dog, when he gets the chance, then completely settles down and sleeps on the bed for hours at a time. Puppy Pete would not have adjusted to this lifestyle very well. The little stinker; I really miss him. There is no doubt that I would be lost without my dog; he gives me a reason to get out of bed, in the freezing cold and go outside. He distracts me from my worries and often makes me laugh. We are together, as I said, 24/7—he is never out of my sight. He dashes across the yard in the rain with me, to use the bathroom. Our timing has gotten good; we combine our potty runs. Topper has learned to drink water and potty on command. True. I don’t leave water inside for him, he only drinks when we go out and he knows he must do his business quickly. After dark I don’t want to wander around with him as he sniffs every bush and he knows it. I take him off leash at the potty place, say; “Go potty, quick” and keep the flashlight on him so I can tell when he squats. I’ll give him two sniffs, usually, then say “Hurry up! Go potty now” and he does. The whole time he’s squatting I praise him, “Good boy! What a fine dog you are! Very good boy.” Of the three of us, Jackie is without doubt the most unhappy; poor kitty. Rarely in his life, until now, has he been locked inside. He always had a cat door and enjoyed visiting with friends up and down our lane. He led an idyllic feline life for eleven years. Because the adjustment has been difficult for him, I have spoiled him rotten; giving him canned food several times a day. Heretofore he only got canned food every other day. He always has dry food out, but canned was used sparingly before. I have created a monster! But more about Jack next week.

       " 'A decade or so ago I came across James Howard Kunstler’s 2005 book The Long Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-first Century. Kunstler argues that the resulting unsustainability of our civilization, the one we live in, including globally — won’t manifest in one big crash, but will be many emergencies, each of which occurs as we attempt to recover from the others. Now, as I write on this gorgeous February morning in the North Valley, I feel the long emergency has arrived. On my way to work in Butte Valley Tuesday, the buttes in the foreground were bright green and those just behind white with the freshly fallen snow. I so appreciate this beauty and the natural wealth of the land where we live. I can appreciate the beautiful morning while being a survivor of the Camp Fire. As a survivor, I live in a limbo — and will for who knows how long —\\xa0 with grievances for myself and family. I grieve too for those who did not have insurance for one reason or another. My husband’s friend lost half a million dollars invested in his home and belongings — everything he worked so hard for, for decades — to the fire. How can he recover? His insurance company cancelled his home policy just weeks before the fire, and he did not find new insurance in time. He is not alone. FEMA’s help is a drop in the bucket, and he and his family are living with relatives like so many other families, packed into a single family home like sardines with no plan except to start over. The local foundation that is collecting and redistributing money for the Camp Fire survivors is not taking grant applications from individuals. This is unfortunate. Instead organizations like the City of Chico have submitted grant applications and received money, such as Chico’s request for money for policing their “invaded” territory. That’s done, and there certainly is a need for policing; however, in the future I hope that local foundation will not grant money that way. Money should be going directly to Camp Fire survivors to rebuild their lives. We are fortunate that there’s a delicious beer being brewed and sold to benefit the survivors called Resilience. (It’s in short supply as there is not currently enough to be available in many outlets.) Thank you Ken Grossman and Sierra Nevada for organizing this nation-wide relief effort. The word resilience appears in many places lately. In light of the long emergency it’s good to use this word resilience and to build on its meaning. A few decades ago, at the founding of Paradise as a Town, the nation was thinking more seriously about things like solar energy, the population explosion, shortages, and crises. People were putting forth initiatives, like the solar system President Carter had installed at the White House to heat the water for showers. Since then there has been some progress with solar systems, but today the population explosion continues, the economy keeps growing along with national debt, and there are many related issues with water, soil, forests, species, and climate change. We’re undoing ourselves in a way the Romans could not have imagined. If they understood the demise of their empire was coming, it happened anyway. Just what are we facing? Paradise’s motto In Harmony With Nature emerged at a time in our nation when we were more collectively attuned to the end of growth and associated problems. Let’s review and recall Paradise’s founding documents as we try to decide who we want to be now, as 2020 approaches, and how we want to rebuild. The Paradise General Plan update is a decade overdue, per California law, and Paradise will be working on this soon I’m certain. Opportunity abounds to make Paradise “All Its Name Implies”, but our mindset, financial situation, and time constraints put us on track to rebuild for a future that looks like what we were used to. It turns out it was not at all in harmony with nature. Yet, we were used to abundance in the form of relatively cheap and available water, energy, and food. In a time of a long emergency, our future is probably not going to be like it was pre-November 8. Let our initiative be to build unconventional with homes that have grey water systems and cisterns for gardens, providing some food security in Paradise. Resilient systems have built-in redundance, in case, for example, the trucks stop rolling in the food from somewhere else. We should have naturally energy efficient homes, in case the electricity and natural gas stop flowing from our designated provider, PG&E. Let’s seek out those architects and designers who know how to build a different kind of home than the current standard, and ask them to help us. Let’s find contractors who can build this way and train others in these skills quickly. Let’s rebuild even more efficiently than California requires. If the emergencies do not end after we rebuild, as is predicted by the climate scientists and people who study sustainability, our only hope is in building for an unconventional future. Building for the new normal, that long emergency, is our best bet for surviving in the near future. Imagine a Town of Paradise that has a re-localized economy and community that can help us through whatever hard times come our way.',\n",
       " 'It was a packed house at Town Hall on Monday morning as the Paradise Town Council voted 5 to 0 to pass an ordinance telling property owners that they needed to move. Ordinance No. 575 states that residents may not live on property where a qualifying structure over 120 square feet has burned until that debris is removed. If the home remains standing, residents may live on the property, either in a home or an RV. Ordinance No. 573, passed by the council on Dec. 11, allowed the temporary placement of an RV on properties in Paradise prior to debris removal. The current ordinance stated while residents property is being cleaned the RV had to be moved anyway, according to town manager Lauren Gill. “What we want to do is rescind that and make a change (to the ordinance) that says a temporary RV cannot be on the property until the debris is removed,” Gill stated. The council wants to work with the state and find some site and locations where people can move their RV while their property is being cleaned, she said. “We want to work with the state Cal OES to prioritize those people who have already pulled a permit for temporary power to get their properties cleaned first.” If residents filled out a Right of Entry form, the town will work with the state to clean those residents’ properties first. The town is working with property owners, including CMA church and state park,s to move their RVs while their property is being cleaned. Currently residents whose homes are still standing can live on their property. Gill stated that residents could return to their property once the debris clean up is complete. FEMA and Cal OES have said that allowing people to live in a public health emergency area will jeopardize the funding which pays for the state debris removal program. Without this funding, the town will not have the resources to remove all the debris. “Either we do this and get our town cleaned up or we don’t and $1.7 billion to clean up the town goes away,” mayor Jody Jones said. The answer from FEMA is that people cannot stay in RVs on their parcel unless its been cleaned no matter how big the lot is, and people with standing houses are allowed to go back and live in them, according to Jones. “What we’re going to do is to work with the state to prioritize the people who have to move because of this action, if the council takes it, get those properties cleaned up first so they can move back on their properties as quickly as possible,” Gill said. “We’re going to work with a private contractor to prioritize those people that have opted out and have gone on to the alternative program.” Gill said the town wants to comply with both the county health officer and with FEMA to protect the town to rebuild. It affects about 100 people, which they pooled for temporary power permits to live on their property before the debris removal was conducted, according to Gill. Cal OES deputy director Eric Lamoureux said if there are 100 to 150 people affected by this, then it is estimated that the clean up would be done within three months. “Our first priority over the next couple of days is to identify all of those sites and if they are not already moving forward on clean up to prioritize clean up on those particular locations,” Lamoureux said. The town is working on several locations where residents can move the RVs to temporarily, including Paradise CMA Church, possibly Lime Saddle campground and possibly Forebay Aquatic Center campground. “We don’t have those locations tied down but we will in the next couple of days and we will have a spot for them to move to,” Jones said. John Cronister said he bought a trailer with cash and moved it on his property. He is in lower Paradise, and he asked who is going to pay for him to move. Cronister said he cannot move the trailer because he does not have a truck and the trailer was delivered for free. “I’m screwed. I don’t want to leave Paradise I love these people. For (the council) to say all this without saying who is paying for this … my property is spotless,” Cronister said. “I’ve cleaned it all. If there’s debris in the air that’s going to kill me I’m already dead. I had a ’73 Volvo 1800ES wagon worth a $104,000. The insurance is offering me $27,000. I’m upset; where are we going (to move)? How close are we going? Who’s going to pay for all this stuff?” He said that what he he has paid for has come out of his pocket.\\xa0 “You say FEMA is going to do this for free, they are not doing it for free,” Cronister said. “They are charging my insurance company what I have on that.” Michael Zuccolillo said it does not make sense to him that it is OK to live in an house on the property and it is not OK to live in a trailer. “It’s illogical, quite frankly it’s stupid,” he said. “Here’s the issue — we need to get our town cleaned up and we have a financial gun to our head.” People in the audience at the meeting yelled out “don’t pass it.” “Excuse me, if you can’t be quiet then you need to leave,” Jones said. “That little bit of hope that we have to bring our community back, I cannot risk that,” councilmember Melissa Schuster said. She said she hated having to make the decision but that she cannot risk the loss of the vision she has of Paradise rebuilt. “Whether you play chicken with FEMA and they pull the funding, I don’t believe our town will get cleaned up and our town will die. i just can’t imagine that,” councilmember Steve Crowder said. “It’s a horrible decision that we have to make, it may not seem it now but for all of us there is only one decision we can make.” Vice mayor Greg Bolin said the town needs the money and the help and it makes it difficult to vote against the ordinance. “It sucks, I don’t want to do it. But I also agree what the other councilmembers have said. If we don’t do it,\\xa0 the town will look like a war zone for the next 20 years,” Jones said. The council voted unanimously to repeal ordinance 573 and approved ordinance 575.',\n",
       " 'CHICO\\xa0— Just 22 Camp Fire survivors are still staying inside at the Red Cross shelter in Chico, according to Butte County. With federal, state and local support, Red Cross caseworkers continue to work with the people remaining at the shelter to help identify safe, stable housing situations for them to move on to. The county had aimed to close the shelter by the end of January but kept it open as some evacuees had no other place to go. Thanks to a $1 million donation from the Butte Strong Fund, caseworkers at the shelter can help remove barriers to evacuees leaving, like money needed for rent or car repairs. When everyone staying inside the shelter is out and Red Cross operations are shut down, people in RVs will be allowed to stay through rental agreements with the fairgrounds, said Casey Hatcher, a spokeswoman for Butte County. The county does not have an estimate for when the shelter will close, Hatcher said.\\xa0The state’s lease with the fairgrounds runs through March 15. As of Tuesday, approximately 69 RVs remained in the north and south parking lots at the fairgrounds and the west lot was empty, Hatcher said. She said it was her understanding that all of those RVs would all be staying once the shelter closed. Rent will be $40 per day. Vehicle owners may receive financial assistance to pay the fairgrounds rent through their insurance, Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance, or, in some cases, with funding from the Butte Strong Fund donation, Hatcher said.',\n",

       " 'Embattled over its role in sparking some of California’s most destructive wildfires, PG&E vowed on Wednesday to shut off power more frequently during dangerous weather conditions in high-threat areas — a safety practice that critics say the utility should have taken last year before the deadly Camp Fire. PG&E unveiled details of the plan in a mandatory wildfire mitigation report submitted to state regulators, warning that almost 10 times the number of customers — or 5.4 million homes equating to its entire service area — could potentially have their electricity shut off during high fire weather episodes, including areas outside high threat zones. In addition to more power shutdowns, PG&E has proposed: Removing 375,000 trees (up 235 percent) and clearing 2,450 miles of vegetation (up 320 percent) that could ignite near power lines. Enhancing inspections on 685,000 distribution poles in high-threat areas, in addition to its routine inspections, and adding four times as many inspections of its transmission towers. Hardening 150 circuit miles (up 880 percent) of its system, including improving 7,100 miles past next year. This would include covering overhead conductors, “select undergrounding” and upgrading equipment in the highest risk areas. Adding 400 weather stations, 70 fire-spotter cameras and private firefighting capabilities to assist Cal Fire in the event of a fire. Allowing transmission lines at 500,000 volts or lower to be deenergized, significantly increasing the number of customers possibly impacted by a power shutdown. The proposal must undergo significant review by the California Public Utilities Commission and the public before being finalized. Some of the goals could be completely reached by the start of fire season in June, but some of the vegetation maintenance increases and other physical improvements would not be finished by then, according to PG&E estimates. However, it’s the preemptive power shutdowns that will be the most noticeable change for the average PG&E customer, as the company plans to shut down larger transmission lines, which could cause communities outside high-threat areas to lose electricity even though the fire threat is not as severe there. PG&E’s de-energization plan last year could have impacted a total of only 570,000 people. The company received criticism after it warned of a possible outage ahead of the deadly Camp Fire, but despite dangerous conditions in Butte County it kept the power on and suffered malfunctions on at least two lines near the fire’s origin. “We know how much our customers rely on electric service. Proactively turning off power is a highly complex issue with significant public safety risks on both sides — all of which need to be carefully considered and addressed,” said Michael Lewis, PG&E electric operations senior vice president. “We understand and appreciate that turning off the power affects first responders and the operation of critical facilities, communications systems and much more. We will only turn off power for public safety and only as a last resort to keep our customers and communities safe.” Attorney Dario\\xa0de Ghetaldi, who is suing PG&E on behalf of Camp Fire victims, reviewed the plan Wednesday afternoon and saw some “good ideas and aggressive timelines.” “As best we can tell, PG&E stopped climbing towers to do their regular five-year inspections in 2009 and started using helicopters to do aerial inspections that are cheaper and take less time,” De Ghetaldi said. “Hopefully, the return to actual tower-climbing inspections will reveal problems like the worn components that failed and started the Camp Fire. As to vegetation management … the devil is in the details.” No official cause has been determined for the Camp Fire, which killed 86 people, but the company’s stock has nose-dived since the blaze and it faces an avalanche of civil litigation from affected residents. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week, listing\\xa0 $51.7 billion in debts and $71.4 billion in assets, according to the filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern California. De Ghetaldi said past fires caused by PG&E show that the company has created programs “that look good on paper but fail in the execution.” The wildfire mitigation plan\\xa0is an attempt to halt a troubling trend the last two years of catastrophic blazes, and it could potentially influence how a federal judge alters the struggling company’s criminal probation terms. All investor-owned utilities under Senate Bill 901 had to submit\\xa0their plans Wednesday that detailed how they planned to prevent, combat and respond to wildfires affecting their service territories. U.S. District Judge William Alsup is presiding over PG&E’s ongoing criminal case, stemming from the 2010 San Bruno gas pipeline explosion that ended with the company convicted on six felonies, and has indicated he will be watching the utility’s plan closely. Last week, Alsup ruled that the company violated its probation terms by not being forthright about causing a number of wildfires in Butte County, and the judge threatened to levy strict and expensive changes to the probation terms. “Does a judge turn a blind eye and let PG&E continue what you’re doing, let you keep killing people?” Alsup asked PG&E attorneys last week inside a San Francisco courtroom during a three-hour evisceration.\\xa0“Can’t we have electricity that is delivered safely in this state?” PG&E has warned that drastic changes to its probation, such as inspecting its entire electrical system before the next fire season, could add significant costs, estimating customer bills could rise five-fold. PG&E was found to have started 17 wildfires over the last two years, and the company has reported electrical malfunctions in the area where the Camp Fire — the state’s most deadly and destructive wildfire — started last year. The PUC will now evaluate the mitigation plan, a process that will include workshops and public comment opportunities. Five other investor-owned utilities — Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric, Liberty Utilities/CalPeco Electric, Bear Valley Electric Service, and Pacific Power — submitted plans Wednesday as well. The first workshop to discuss the plans is set for Feb. 13.',\n",

       " 'PARADISE\\xa0— A long-term project to remove trees in Paradise and Magalia that were killed by the Camp Fire is getting underway, and the first phase of the effort is planned to include limited commercial logging. The Butte County Fire Safe Council is seeking to change the scope of a previously approved $668,000 grant for fuel reduction on the Paradise ridge to jump start a three-phase, multi-year program to get the tons of dead wood off the ridge. The Fire Safe Council conducted a survey based on a number of datum points throughout Paradise and Magalia, and determined 81 percent of the large conifers\\xa0— 12 inches or more in diameter at breast height\\xa0— were killed by the fire. That amounts to 443,000 dead trees, and that’s just the larger hazard trees, within 300 feet of residences. That doesn’t count those along utility lines and roadways, where PG&E, the town and the county are removing trees. Fire Safe Council member and former Paradise fire chief Jim Broshears told the group Wednesday that PG&E alone has identified 130,000 trees that are hazards to its lines and has removed about 30,000. But removing those other 443,000 dead trees will be the responsibility of homeowners. It will cost in the neighborhood of $750 million, Broshears said. However for a few months after a fire, the wood in trees killed by the flames has some commercial value. That’s why in the last month the Fire Safe Council developed a pilot project to get lumber companies to help remove some of the wood. A lot of residents think someone will pay them for lumber harvested from their lot, but urban logging presents so many challenges and requires such specialized equipment that it isn’t profitable, and loggers won’t touch those jobs. Only if a larger area can be made available can a lumber firm cover its costs. So the pilot project will start on large swaths owned by the Paradise Irrigation District and the Paradise Pine Property Owners Association. However homeowners in two neighborhoods will also be contacted to see if they also want to participate: South Coutelenc in Magalia and Paradise evacuation zone 2. Letters were to be sent out this week.           Broshears said four lumber companies were considering participation, but, “We’re not doing them a favor; they really don’t need our logs.” There’s limited mill capacity, which is why only two neighborhoods were included. “That’s all we can get to mill.” He said there’s also a possibility for a small export market. If the change in the initial grant is approved, logging on the PID and POA lands could begin by the end of the month. The work would not begin in South Coutelenc until March and in Paradise zone 2 until April. Fire Safe Council Executive Director Calli-Jane DeAnda said she thought the change would be approved, as the initial grant was for fuel reduction and that’s what’s being proposed. If the first phase does generate any revenue, it will be held by a third-party accounting firm for use on the second phase, which is subsidizing tree removal. The Fire Safe Council is seeking a $19 million bio-hazard reduction grant to assist with that effort. Broshears said for many property owners, the cost of removing the trees will exceed the value of their lot.\\xa0He said homeowners should use their debris removal insurance for that purpose if they have it. The second phase should begin in summer. The third phase is long-term: reforestation of Paradise and maintenance of the new forest. That will include engaging the public to figure out what that new forest will be. It will be a “model forest,” Broshears said, “and that model hasn’t been developed.” “We need to get back to a healthy forest; to the condition we wished it was in the first place.” But he said the town can’t recover without first removing the dead trees. “It’s is going to be a big project. It’s going to take all these things and a few more we haven’t thought of.”',\n",

According to Butte County Fires, Accidents, Crimes Facebook page the plaque was chiseled out of the stone planter that was placed in front of the Stage Stop on Bille Road in the 1970s. In the post Duncan said his father, Larry Duncan Sr, a former Paradise Irrigation District Director, installed the plaque to pay tribute to the man who sustained the building in 1970. “That’s when a man Ronald Max saved the building from being destroyed,” Larry said in the post. The building, set up to be demolished in the 70s, was likely a stage stop according to the younger Duncan. When Larry’s father bought the building in the 1970s, he placed a plaque in Max’s honor.

       " 'When natural disasters strike, first responders – police, fire, emergency personnel – get a lot of attention and well–deserved praise. But there is another category of worker that goes unnoticed, and while they don’t save lives they do provide a lifeline that helps to restore them: the postal worker. Like everything else, the Camp Fire that incinerated much of Paradise and neighboring Magalia created enormous turmoil for one of life’s most dependable staples: mail delivery, but the United States Postal Service has done a remarkable job getting the mail to people who lived there, who lost everything, who may still have a home, or who have been displaced and are living elsewhere, in the state or out of it, with family and friends. It was an enormous challenge. Mail had been accumulating since the fire struck on November 8 and at a time when volume is at its heaviest, the Christmas season. Cards, letters, catalogs touting Black Friday sales and, of course, Christmas presents. By the time postal workers in Paradise began tackling this volume, they were facing a six–week backlog of mail. “We were playing catch–up from day one in what was an unprecedented situation,” said Mike Johnson, the Paradise postmaster. His office had become a war room. The phone rang constantly. Subordinates would poke their heads in with questions. On a wall–mounted cork board were tacked names, dates, assignments and deadlines. A large dry–erase board stood in a corner, a list of tasks written over the ghost–like film of writings erased from the previous day’s schedule. He needed it all. Postal employees from all over the state were volunteering to help, many of them working 18–hour days. “We had over 100 mail carriers delivering just packages,” Johnson said. “One guy came from San Diego and stayed for three weeks. The District Manager and his staff were up here [from Sacramento] every day in those first weeks.” Because the Paradise office didn’t reopen until December 17, all the mail for Paradise and Magalia was sent to the post office in nearby Chico, which first had to accommodate its own mail volume, then find space to organize the mail for Paradise. On average, the Chico office receives anywhere from 5,000 to 7,000 packages daily through a combination of the Postal Service, FedEx, UPS and Amazon. (The Postal Service delivers many parcels of its competitors.) On one particular day though, with the Chico office accepting mail for both itself and Paradise, the count for packages was 36,500 – most of it for Paradise and Magalia. There was an additional challenge. No one was sure where everyone’s mail would go. Typically, mail is first sorted through an automation process at a central distribution plant, in this case, the plant in West Sacramento, which is one 16 such plants in California. Sorting is done according to individual addresses for each designated route, then trucked in or flown to individual offices. But nearly 14,000 of the roughly 17,000 homes in the Paradise district were destroyed. Sorting mail by route to addresses where homes no longer existed was a non–starter. Instead, the plant revamped its process, sorting the mail alphabetically. Once it arrived, first in Chico and later in Paradise, workers broke it down into four categories: letters, flats (magazines, catalogs and large envelopes), small parcels, and large boxes. Another challenge surfaced: forwarding addresses. As residents who’d lost their homes found new places to live, they filed to have their mail forwarded to their new address. This didn’t happen all at once. For people who’d lost everything, getting their mail wasn’t the first order of business. New forwards came in daily and each time that happened, postal workers had to find that mail, which had already been shipped to Paradise, and send it back to the plant in West Sacramento for re–sorting so it could be sent to countless other postal districts where dislocated Paradise residents had moved. By December’s end, there were 17,000 changes of address, according to Johnson. “It was uncharted territory,” Johnson said. “Things were changing daily and we had to adjust accordingly.” Most of us never see what happens behind the scenes of a post office. When you walk into one you’re typically greeted by rows of postal boxes. A long counter lines a central room, manned by clerks who service approaching customers. An island counter sits in the middle containing forms, labels, envelops. Behind that counter is a wall, and behind that wall lies a cavernous shipping area bustling with activity. Stacks of mail are everywhere: letters; flats; small packages and large boxes. There are pallets, hampers, cages, trays and tubs – things the mail is delivered in at a loading dock out back. An entire section houses shelves and cabinets filled with supplies. Carriers are at their stations, called cases, sorting mail, organizing it for delivery. It’s noisy. It’s busy, like a beehive. If you’d never been back there you could easily get lost, but all the workers know what they’re doing and know where they’re going. The Paradise post office reopened on December 17. By the day after Christmas, when I visited, the line of customers arriving to pick up mail was out the door. Others were milling around, waiting, but the ad–hoc system management had devised was working. A customer would approach the counter handing a clerk a slip with their information and identification, the clerk would hand that slip to a runner who disappeared into the shipping area and then reappear with the customer’s mail. Most people waited in line around 15 minutes. “I’ve never been so excited to get bills,” said Candy Savage, who was celebrating her 58th birthday. I asked about the bills that had been mailed weeks ago and were past due. “DirecTV told us we needed to return their equipment. I told them I’d sweep it up and put it in an envelope,” she said, laughing. She was in good spirits considering she’d lost her home of 27 years. Similarly, other customers were walking out into the post office parking lot with smiling faces, bundles of mail in their hands. Many of Paradise’s residents are retirees. They grew up in a time when people wrote personal letters sent in an envelope instead of texts sent on a phone. They wave hello as carriers drive by. At Christmas time they often leave some sort of gratuity in the mailbox – baked goods or candy, a gift card, even cash. The mail meant something to them then. With their world turned upside down by the Camp Fire, the mail was meaning something to them now. “It’s nice to have at least one piece of stability back,” said Patricia Dixon, 69, who came to the Paradise post office after spending nearly a month with her son in Laguna Beach. A state worker, she was holding a stack of mail and several small boxes she’d ordered before the fire. “Dishes for my dogs,” she said. “They’re my babies.” She lost her house but still had the dogs and just bought a mobile home in Chico. “Will I rebuild?’ she mused. “I dunno, do I have that kind of time?” It’s unknown how many will return to rebuild, especially for the area’s retirees who may have neither time nor the financial means to rebuild their homes quickly, if at all. Such changes will drastically impact the area’s postal employees, too. More than two dozen carriers in Chico and Paradise lost their homes to the blaze, and with thousands of other homes destroyed, many of them will also lose their mail routes. Before the fire, Paradise had 17 designated mail routes. Based on what’s left standing, that number will likely be reduced to four or five, according to Johnson, the Postmaster. The rest of the mail carriers will have to transfer to other districts where routes are available, maybe in nearby Oroville or Yuba City, if they’re lucky, or farther away, say, Modesto, Southern California, perhaps even out of state. They weren’t thinking about that when I visited. Instead they were toiling at their work stations in the Paradise office, organizing mail and servicing existing customers as best they could. Theresa Knowles has been with the Postal Service for 22 years and, at 52, has lived in Magalia all her life. Her home of 33 years was destroyed, as were the homes of her three grown children. “I went to see my place. I don’t know if you’re ever prepared for how bad it was going to be,” she said. Yet, like her coworkers, she was in the office, at her case, surrounded by trays of mail and stacks of packages, sorting it, bundling it, one piece at a time. “We have a job to do,” she said. “People still need their mail and you gotta take care of the customers.” She paused for a moment: “I lost one customer on my route. An older man always out there, always working on his yard.” Eighty–five others also lost their lives. The Christmas presents they were supposed to get had their own fate, either returned to sender or given to surviving family members. It’s likely every mail carrier in the Paradise office had at least one customer who died and, like Knowles, they probably knew that customer by name. It’s common for carriers to get to know their customers that way. Knowles is working on mail for more than just her route, which had 832 homes before the fire. “I drove the route the other day,” she said. “I counted 106 homes still standing.” Given her seniority, she’ll be able to stay in Paradise and get one of the remaining routes after they’ve been redrawn from the existing homes and businesses. Would she consider relocating? “I’d rather go back to my burnt property and rebuild,” she said. “This is my home. These are my customers.” Christmas has come and gone and life is becoming a little more orderly, in small part, thanks to the mail. “The challenge was overwhelming,” said Johnson, “but everyone pulled together. The District Manager’s attitude was, ‘whatever it takes.’ That sort of camaraderie really helped us all in moving forward.”',\n",
       " 'Paradise Unified School District superintendent Michelle John sent out a letter to all PUSD parents, students, staff and also community members Thursday to survey the community on returning to the ridge for 2019-2020 school year. John wrote in the letter the school district will soon send out a survey to parents and guardians their thoughts on returning to Paradise for the 2019-20 school year once sites are cleaned and when the district receives clearance on air, soil and water quality. As the town begins to clean up, so do the schools, the letter stated. The district’s goal is to return to Paradise for Paradise High School senior graduating class to return to Om Wraith Field on June 6. “The first thing that we are concentrating is getting the high school ready for graduation,” she said. “We’re focusing on tree removal and soil clean up.” The school district’s plan is to open Paradise High School and Paradise Intermediate School in\\xa0August that is if the soil, air, and water quality is safe. They have cleaned up Pine Ridge School and Pine Ridge students are currently occupying the facility. Four schools are fully destroyed she noted. The debris removal should be completed in 60 days for just the schools that have damage she told the Post. Paradise Unified schools are on the top of the list for Cal OES for clean up John said. “When the district rebuilds we can rebuild 21st century schools,” she said. “When we return to the high school hopefully in August we will be concentrating on our Construction, Welding and Engineering programs so our students are prepared to rebuild in our town. We are going to gear up (those programs ) to meet the needs of our town.” The district intends to run activity-based, problem solving, academic programs including Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, Visual and Performing Arts, Career Technical Education and also athletics. John wrote in the letter “we will need help with building our schools and our community, but never doubt the small community of Paradise will do just that,” John wrote. “Our students need and deserve this. We look forward to you being apart of the rebuilding process.” She stated in the letter that Paradise unified will begin a communication campaign tentatively titled “Coming Home.” “Coming home is a positive marketing campaign to let the students know we are coming home and we want our students to come home with us,” she said. K-8 Magalia students are in Magalia and the high school students are currently being bussed down Fortress Street in Chico. PUSD will provide busing up the hill next school year John said. “Our goal is to bring our students and teachers up to Paradise,” she said. The survey will help decide on how quickly we need to rebuild our schools depending on how many students return. The total district population is 56 percent of what was pre-Camp Fire, according to John.',\n",
       " 'FOREST RANCH — A bobcat that had been badly burned in the Camp Fire was released back into the wild Sunday at the\\xa0Big Chico Creek Ecological Reserve. The bobcat was brought to Gold Country Wildlife Rescue on Nov. 28 with fifth-degree burn damage from the Camp Fire. According to chairman Sallysue Stein, this is the first burn animal the rescue had nurtured back to health. “We took him to a vet the next day in Fair Oaks. As soon as she saw him, she could see that the bone was exposed in all the pads (of his paws),” Stein said. “She then contacted Dr. Jamie Peyton at UC Davis who’s doing the Tilapia fish skin research.” After contacting Peyton, the bobcat had Tilapia skin applied to the burns that showed improvement in less than a week, Stein said. “We took him in Wednesday, Friday he got the first fish skin. I took him back to Davis Monday and the improvement in three days of the fish skin treatment is unbelievable. Literally it’s unbelievable,” Stein said. Aside from the Tilapia skin treatment, the bobcat also received antibiotics, pain medication, cold laser treatments, electromagnetic therapy, burn cream and acupuncture. Gold County Wildlife Rescue also received two foxes from the Camp Fire that are still in recovery. Stein said they get a lot of “regular animals” like squirrels and birds but they’re beginning to receive more critical cases like this one. When animals are released into the wild, the goal is to put them back to the environment they came from, or close to it. “We get animals from all over but we try to get them as close to their area from where they came from,” Stein said. This is the first animal that has been released at the Big Chico Creek\\xa0Ecological Reserve, according to Eli Goodsell, director of Ecological Reserves. “Since I’ve been here for a year and a half we haven’t released any animals, but then again we haven’t had any type of disaster like the Camp Fire,” Goodsell said. “It does align directly with our mission of conservation, forest health and wildlife diversification.” Bears, foxes, eagles, bobcats and other animals roam the reserve’s 3,950 acres. The reserve was created with the the purchase of Simmons Ranch in 1999 and Henning Ranch in 2001, according to the reserve’s  . It is now owned by the Chico State University Research Foundation. The reserve offers internships and hosts classes for university students as well as field trips for kids in kindergarten through 12th grade.           Goodsell said it is important that the Department of Fish and Wildlife want to release animals at the reserve because the land is so well-kept. Stein and Goodsell talked about releasing the two foxes that are currently in rehabilitation at the reserve within the next few weeks. Releasing the animals is the best part of the process, Stein said. “It’s why we do this. It’s our reward. We don’t get paid for this, we’re all volunteers. It’s my passion and this is why,” Stein said. “We just need to give them a second chance and that’s what it’s all about. When we are successful and can release them it makes all of the work worth while.”',\n",
       " 'More than 800 attendees on Friday evening filled the\\xa0Paradise Performing Arts Center’s seats for a Camp Fire celebration of life memorial as the community came together to honor 85 lives lost in November’s fire. Inside the dark lit auditorium some attendees were crying as poems, songs, prayers, dance, various language translations were seen and heard during the memorial that included a two-minute moment of silence was attributed to the lives lost. At the end of the memorial the lights came on and the audience was clapping along to Celebration Gospel Choir. Outside in the lobby, photos of the lives lost with their biographies were placed on tables decorated with roses along with colorful children’s artwork on the windows. Attendees wrote “love notes to Butte (County) on a banner-sized white paper with many multi-colored notes that read words like “Paradise Strong” and “like the Phoenix you shall rise reborn from the ashes.” Christina Taft, attended the celebration of life to honor her mother Victoria Taft who’s life was lost in the Camp Fire. ”I liked that they put the victims’ photos out there and their biographies outside,” Taft said. “I wish that they would have shown more pictures and biographies (in the memorial) but I’m glad they’re still mentioning them.” She said her mother was very loyal, very missed and overprotective. A poem “Please excuse the smoke” by Paradise native Krystalynn Martin was meaningful to her at the memorial she noted. “When she was going into exact details (reciting the poem) about memories of going to the Safeway Plaza area because my mom and I lived by there,” Taft said, who added that her mom would walk over there and buy the $5 Friday deals and frequently went to all those places. “The specific details meant a lot to me because all of that is kind of lost now,” Taft said. The memories in town were brought back at the memorial. “How meaningful it is to me because my mom is gone and the places we went to.” Paradise performers Jason and Lindsay Beltz wrote and performed a song that they hoped would make people feel good and that they could relate to the experience. “(The memorial) was a need to come together, we need more events to come together and this is healthy,” Jason said. The song was true to what the experience of the couple escaping the fire they said. Seeing all the pictures put out in the lobby made it real the couple said. Terri Saenz and Mike Hanko attended the memorial in remembrance of their brother Mike Hanko. Saenz said Mike was always helping out people in the community and was an outgoing and very positive person. “He was the youngest of five siblings so it’s hard to accept,” Saenz said. “(This memorial) was the extra support that helps get over that hill.” Mike said the celebration of life helps for people in the community that don’t know the people who died in the fire but now they do. “They had an opportunity to come and read about them and maybe meet some of the families,” he said. Michelle Radar, office manager of The Gold Nugget Museum said the celebration of life was touching. “It helped to release emotion but it also brought joy, the music was beautiful,” she said. “It was great to have all of the faiths coming together to honor the lives that were lost and bringing us all together.” The memorial was wonderful but it will take a long time for the town to heal from this, she noted. Radar knew and described Gold Nugget docent and Camp Fire victim John Sedwick, as a treasured historian, amazing musician and storyteller. “He volunteered of Gold Nugget Days and Days of Living History, we’ll miss him,” Radar said. Sam Gronseth attended the memorial and said it is hard to put into words. Each life (lost in the fire) is a real person with moms, dads, children and friends he noted. “As I was going, looking through the pictures it’s good to catch a glimpse,” Gronseth said. “People that I had little connection with but we all had a connection in the fire and the escape and the tragedy that happened within it.” He said it’s important to honor the past but it’s important to move forward. “I think it helps with closure for everyone to be able to say goodbye to those we’ve lost and be able to move forward when we’re ready to move forward,” he commented. “I’m not rushing that, moving forward.” Gronseth thanked the organizers of the event. Chico Interfaith Council organized the Camp Fire Celebration of Life on Friday, Feb. 8 at Paradise Performing Arts Center.',\n",
       " 'Until Nov. 8, 2018 Jack Cat led an idyllic feline life; his own door and freedom to come and go as he pleased. Our area was safe for a cat, especially so because we were at the end of a little dirt lane, therefore no traffic. He usually spent most days outside, visiting around the neighborhood where he was well known. Halfway up the lane was a tall wooden gate, otherwise surrounded by brush and trees obscuring any view of the property beyond; apparently only feral cats lived there. It was a small closed colony; that is all spayed/neutered, no new additions. They were fed by the property owner, usually once a day. Around feeding time, which varied greatly, some of the cats waited in front of the gate; they had a ‘quick escape’ hole under the gate and were impossible to approach by anyone but the owner, otherwise. The first five years of Jack’s life, I worked full time so he was on his own all day. He often filled it commiserating with the ferals at the “Feral Cat Gate.” I didn’t even know about it the first couple of years; feeding was in the afternoon so I never saw him down there. To my embarrassment, which I often discussed with the owner, once retired and home in the afternoons, he showed up and waited amongst them and ate heartedly as if he were a starving cat. The food was the exact same he got at home, but that didn’t seem to matter. It was so odd, at first, when I drove up the lane; there would be Jackie, hanging out with the ferals. He always followed me home and no matter where he was in the neighborhood, he always came home when I called him. Right from the day I brought him home, at about nine or 10 weeks, he was a bold, fearless kitten; my first Schippeke, Bobby was a young playful dog and they became best friends. Partners in crime is more accurate. They played so wild, for so long, I’d finally have to put Jack in his room. Yes, he had his own room. He stayed in there at night and whenever I needed a time out from him; he never stopped playing and pestering the dogs. Because he couldn’t go outside until fully vaccinated and little older, I had a complicated ritual of locking the cat the door whenever Jack was out of his room and opening it up, so the other cats could come and go, when he was ensconced in his bedroom. Forgetting one or the other and timing it all just right was sometimes a challenge. The thing is, he was started with confinement, locked inside with a cat box and learned it was okay. Once he could go out, that was his preference; I never had to have a cat box for him. That’s one of the main reasons I love cats; they take care of themselves, given the opportunity. Jack’s last moment of freedom was the morning I threw him in a big dog crate with a cat box, in the car, with Puppy Pete and Topper in a crate next to him, as we fled the fire. We stayed the first two nights in Live Oak where we had a bedroom, he could be locked in. He stayed under the bed the first night and only came out to use his cat box, shunning food the first evening. The second night he slept on the bed with me and ate. Then we moved to our present location, the fifth wheel in the country. His cat box is conveniently located in the shower that is unused, anyway. The first month my son slept in the living room and Jack pretty much hung out in there; me and the dog were in the bedroom. Once he got his own place, I only heat the bedroom, so Jack stays in here most of the time. From the beginning he meowed and meowed. It only got louder, longer and more frequent no matter what I did; I finally opened the door, but he didn’t want to go out. The only thing that shut him up was a can of Fancy Feast. Used to be he got a can a day, but that quickly escalated to three or four cans a day or however many he demanded. He was on the thin side normally and only after three months of his new diet has just barely reached a good weight. So, I decided to give him whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted it; the poor kitty. If he was comfort eating, that is just fine with me. But I have created a monster for sure; when he gets too fat and I have to cut him back, they’ll be hell to pay. Happily, in just the last week, Jack has gained freedom when he wants it (and sometimes when he doesn’t). It’s a good place for cats, mostly, and he explores around the property, staying pretty close, but venturing to my close neighbor, Ray’s place and has now met Gray Cat, AKA Larry, his resident cat. Jack has now been inside with Ray and Larry a few times, just visiting. He’s so much easier to live with now! He can be social when he wants or just hang around in the sun. It certainly makes ME feel better! Jacky is settling in and enjoying life again.',\n",

Assembly Bill 430 would accelerate\\xa0the environmental review process for certain housing projects to help alleviate the local housing crisis which was exacerbated by the Camp Fire. “The legislature has streamlined environmental review for sports arenas,” Gallagher said in a press release. “Surely we can do the same for housing, especially for people who are recovering from a catastrophic event.” Assembly Bill 431 would exempt forest health and fuel reductions projects like thinning overgrown trees and vegetation from\\xa0the California Environmental Quality Act. The bill also calls for exemptions for improvements to evacuation routes in the town of Paradise. Additionally, the legislation would loosen regulations for the proposed construction of a sewer system for the town’s business district. “I’m very excited — we’ve estimated that this will save us two years and $4-5 million for a project that is going to be instrumental in rebuilding Paradise,” said Paradise Mayor Jody Jones, in the release from Gallagher’s office.',\n",
       " 'Camp Fire survivors are under threat of being evicted from the Lime Saddle campground, as it is a California State Park with a 30 day maximum stay. Currently state parks have been trying a week by week arrangement for Camp Fire survivors. Aaron Wright, public safety chief of Northern Buttes District, wrote a letter in response to a Paradise resident regarding the evictions. “Many of my family, friends, and staff have also been impacted by the Camp Fire so I understand your concerns,” he wrote. “I have authorized staff to allow seven day extensions at a time to the 30 day limit on a case by case basis at Lime Saddle Campground. We have held to the 30 day limit to give as many people possible the opportunity to utilize the campground.” “There is a high demand for all of the campsites,” he added. “We are also not equipped to provide for long term housing with things like laundry facilities. We will work with people as they try to find other housing arraignments.” Bidwell Canyon Campground is being set up for evacuees he added in the letter. “We are actively working closely with our partners on solutions for longer term housing areas,” he said in the statement. Lena Ingoglia, 50, a Camp Fire survivor from Paradise has been living on the campground for a month with her husband and son and is facing eviction from the campground. FEMA and other agencies are making exceptions to normal state regulations and even federal regulations due to the state of emergency, according to Ingoglia. She works for a medical clinic and said Medicare has lifted regulations for providers to go to shelters to treat patients during the state of emergency. “If Medicare can make exceptions, certainly the California state parks can,” she added. They had pulled permits to get her parents property ready, on Jan. 28 they received a call from the county saying they will put a hold on the permit. Her husband called Butte County Supervisor Doug Teeter who told her husband that FEMA was going to withdraw funds if the county didn’t get everyone off the property and that no permits are going to be granted. “We knew by Feb. 4 they were not going to honor our permit,” she said. They were planning to move out of the park by Feb. 1. They had bought travel trailers to move into at her parent’s house near the tree farm to be away from a burn structure. They pulled permits when FEMA threatened to pull their funds if the town and the county did not remove the trailers, she said. They moved into the campground on Jan. 10 and last Thursday it had been 29 days in the campground. She claims they were told that if they moved their trailers to a different space that the 30 day clock would start over. They moved them to two different camp sites, they paid a week’s stay at the campground but they say that on Saturday morning the park ranger told them their 30 days are up. Ingoglia said that the park ranger told them he was not going to cite or evict them but by Monday they needed to move out.\\xa0 She added they passed on rental opportunities\\xa0 because they were planning on moving to her parents place. Those rental opportunities are no longer available. She said it will be at least the 10th time\\xa0 they have moved since the Camp Fire. “We’re out of loss of use funds, FEMA won’t step in but because (it says) you bought a trailer we consider you housed. We have been hemorrhaging money left and right,” she said. “We’ve spent $14,000 in hotel fees for the first two months and another $2,000 to $3,000 at the marina.” It’s financially and emotionally devastating she added. The state parks have a fee of $45 per day and pay $6 extra per car. An annual parking pass can’t be bought at the campground. Campground has water and power but no internet. The campground is normally open from April to October but they opened it early by FEMA’s request. They have not eased the 30 day restriction she noted. The campgrounds have work crews that have been staying there since December, according to Ingoglia. “The park ranger that knocked on our door Saturday morning has a mandate to follow through and unless someone above him does anything he’s going to have to follow through and we don’t have anywhere to go, “ she said. People she has been talking living at the campgrounds don’t have a place to go she noted. When they moved out of a hotel on Jan. 10 they intended to stay a couple of weeks until they received the permit, she said. Another resident facing a similar dilemma. Shawn Hamilton, 60-years-old, a former Vicki’s Kitchen owner from Magalia is disabled and had to move out with his RV today. “It’s frustrating because I made arrangements to move into \\xa0a long-term park on Friday and said on Wednesday you’ll be trespassing and (the park ranger) left,” he said. Hamilton has been on the move since Nov. 8. “First we get kicked out of town and then we get kicked out of the campground, this is the fourth place I’ve stayed,” he said. “What else are you going to do.” He claims that he has been staying at the campground for 25 days but the campground told him that he has been there for 55 days, according to Hamilton. However, his brother had been living at the campground for 30 days he added. He claims that the state has been selective in it has asked to leave. When he moved into the campground there were only five RV’s he said. “I know most of these people living here have kids but for the most part it has been cold so no one has been out and about,” he said. In attempt to contact Wright for comment on the 30 day rule, a comment was not returned.',\n",
       " 'CHICO\\xa0— Preparations are being made at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds to take in 61 Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers to house Camp Fire evacuees. Rain has been holding back construction of a space for the RVs in the north lot area with new pavement, lighting and hookups, but the RVs should be ready for use about 35 days after construction crews break ground, said Nick DiGrazia, CEO of the Silver Dollar Fair. The fair board signed an 18-month contract with FEMA effective Feb. 1 including a 6-month term and month-to-month extensions for up to 12 months. “It’s a lot of work to make it nice,” DiGrazia said. “That was my whole stipulation, to make it nice.” The Red Cross shelter for Camp Fire evacuees is still operational at the fairgrounds, and evacuees are staying in private RVs there as well. Those RVs will be allowed to stay in an area separate from the FEMA trailers once the shelter shuts down, said DiGrazia. Shelby Boston, director of the county department of employment and social services, told the Butte County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday morning that the Red Cross shelter would likely close by Friday. Just nine evacuees remained inside, Boston said. The 63 RVs remaining will be allowed to stay, though the vehicle owners will have to start paying a daily fee soon. They may be eligible for financial assistance. Prior to serving as a consolidated Red Cross shelter, the fairgrounds served as a meet-up place for evacuated parents, teachers and students, then as the incident base for Cal Fire and law enforcement personnel including search and rescue teams. Even President Donald Trump passed through. All of that activity meant that fundraisers and weddings and\\xa0quinceañeras were cancelled. DiGrazia said he slept in his office for the first few nights after the fire broke out Nov. 8. He noted that there had not been much time to transition between different uses of the space. “We’ve been going the whole time, nonstop,” DiGrazia said. “We’re here for the community.” He said that RV-dependent events would be impacted by the trailers on site, and some people visiting for events would have to dry camp, but productions including the annual Silver Dollar Fair would go on. Meanwhile, about 40 families are living in FEMA RVs at the Yuba-Sutter Fairgrounds. Camp Fire evacuees first started moving into the trailers in December, said\\xa0Dave Dillabo, CEO of the Yuba-Sutter Fair. The fair board also negotiated a 6-month contract with possibility of extensions up to 18 months. Dillabo said the RVs are in a corner on the east side of the fairgrounds. Dillabo said he had not heard any complaints, despite the trailers being located in a residential area. There has been   for FEMA trailers, including one in north Chico, with neighbors citing concerns about increased traffic and other possible impacts. “It’s been very clean, he said. “No major issues.” He said other events, including the fair, should be able to go on. “We’re making plans to work around that,” Dillabo said. Up to 350 FEMA modular or mobile home units are   in Gridley. Another 48 FEMA modular home units   in Chico in the next three months. In Orland, 51 mobile home units   and 26 units are housing families at the Glenn County Fairgrounds. There are also FEMA trailers at the Bidwell Canyon Marina in Oroville and the Rolling Hills Casino in Corning.',\n",

       " 'CHICO — Adventist Health will not try to reopen Camp Fire-damaged Feather River Hospital, at least for the time being. In the meantime,\\xa0 more than 1,300 employees have been laid off, receiving paychecks until last week. Following California law, the nonprofit health system submitted a required Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification letter to the state, outlining its intentions affecting more than 1,300 full and part time employees who work for Adventist Health Feather River Hospital and contract agencies such as Cerner and Atria. Adventist Health conducted a townhall meeting for employees on Dec. 5 in Chico, talking about the future, and also sent an email to the workforce. Other media have reported the hospital told employees it might look at reopening in 2020. Dated Jan. 8, the WARN letter to the state was distributed to workforce development services, governments and others, notifying them that the employer and employees were going through permanent or temporary layoffs. Calls and emails for comment were made to both Adventist Health and Paradise town manager Lauren Gill. In December, Adventist Health told the San Francisco Chronicle that the 100-bed hospital was “severely damaged and services will not be restored until 2020 at the earliest.” It also told the Chronicle that it had agreed to pay all employees’ full salaries through Feb. 5, and that health benefits would continue until May.           While some Feather River departments won’t reopen, others may be relocated. On Monday, some of those hospital employees sat in on an employment workshop hosted by the Alliance for Workforce Development in Chico, which received the WARN notice. Kristine Farrell, assistant director for the alliance, said about 10 attended the Chico workshop on Monday, and that another workshop was planned on Friday. The alliance’s focus in this case is on displaced workers, answering questions on unemployment insurance claims, along with ways to look for new work, and if retraining is needed. Of the employees’ demeanor, she said, “They seemed OK. I think they knew something was going to come like this.” As to the low number of attendees, Farrell said some may still be struggling with feelings about the fire, or have been unable to find housing and left the community. Others are still getting paid, and have not started on the rebuilding process. Regarding the hospital’s future, Farrell said, “I don’t know much about what’s in store for their future, but for right now, they’re not going to reopen. But they might be in the future.” The alliance is part of the state-devised Rapid Response Team to help employers as well as employees deal with changing employment situations. There still are a number of Adventist Health facilities that are carrying on, including the Adventist Health clinic on the Skyway in Paradise, which recently reopened, and ones in Chico. According to the WARN letter, the facilities being closed include the hospital on Pentz Road, the Hospice House, the anti-coagulation clinic and Feather River pulmonary and urology. Other services have or may be relocated, including Canyon View Clinic, Gastroenterology, Family Health Center, Feather River EMT, Total Women’s Health, Paradise Surgical, Feather River Surgical Associates and Feather River Neurology, the letter indicated. Feather River Hospital was Paradise’s largest employer in an area where it provided health care services not only to the local residents, but to others beyond the town limits. Farrell noted that Chico, Butte County and beyond have always been hungry for health care workers, and that some of those with health care skills will be able to find openings whether in private practice or in hospital settings. Nonmedical\\xa0 personnel, be it in accounting or administration, have opportunities throughout the region, although they may have to travel for work. Butte County is seeing the lowest unemployment in years, which means the employment pool is tight for area companies. “Employers have been struggling with finding people,” she said. Farrell noted that many of the employees were still being paid by Adventist Health while not working, saying that was not typical. As for the alliance services, Farrell said the process of applying for unemployment can be confusing, so that’s why assistance is encouraged. “We are there to help the job search, make a connection, help them revamp their resumes. When you’ve been employed by one company for a long time, you may not know how to do these.” “We can help them navigate through unemployment, (state) benefits.” They might need help paying for transportation in the job hunt or getting appropriate clothes for interviews, or updating their resumes, she noted, and the alliance has resources for that. Employment specialists can help them review their careers and see if other areas might be more satisfying. On Tuesday, Enloe Medical Center’s Nicole Johnannson said since the fire the Chico hospital has hired about 100 from Feather River, and she knew that Adventist Health was trying to place employees in its other facilities.

       " 'After signing a package of fire recovery and emergency response bills, Governor Gavin Newsom visited Pine Ridge Elementary School Thursday to meet with local leaders and talk to Camp Fire survivors. The bills — AB 72 and 73 — provide emergency funding to local governments like those in Butte County which have been rocked by recent California wildfires. By backfilling local property taxes, the funding allows schools to reopen, and local government to stay afloat and begin rebuilding efforts. The new funding will help keep kids in classrooms at schools like Pine Ridge Elementary, a recently reopened school that many students who survived the Camp Fire now attend. On Thursday afternoon, Gov. Newsom visited the school, meeting with local leaders who are directing recovery efforts and talking to students who were impacted by the fire. “We signed legislation on Wednesday committing something the state of California has never committed to any community and that’s three years to offset and backfill 100 percent of the property tax losses of this community and also to do the same for the school system,” Gov. Newsom said. A bill was signed worth $50 million for emergency planning and emergency preparedness, $30 million will go out through the governor’s office, $20 million will go through Cal OES in grants he noted.The money is ready to be invested in the community he added. “They also put a down payment on upgrading 9-1-1 system,” Newsom said.” All of these things within the first 40 days of the calendar year.” Some questions asked in the audience were about debris removal, PG&E and preventative measures if future wildfires occur. “The bill that (Gov. Newsom) had announced (Thursday) signed is substantial and it’s to stabilize everything to give the hope and assurance and we’re going to be in for the long run. This isn’t even legislative bills of this year,” Sen. Jim Nielson said. “It will be several years we’re going to be working on various and sundry parks including the CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act) business.” Last year California SB 901 Wildfire Bill was passed to spend $200 million a year for the next five years. “The governor put in his budget the funding for that billion dollars,” Republican assemblyman Brian Dahle, who represents Magalia, said. “That money is going to be coming to the ground and doing vegetation management.” If the budget is approved the local responsibility for debris removal will be waived which is anticipated to be $146 million that the community will not be burdened with, Newsom noted. “The state of California will pick up 100 percent of that local responsibility, that’s a general fund contribution, that’s in our budget,” Newsom said. “That is something else we hope could allay some of the stress of the community.” Many challenges are going to come forward over the years of rebuilding the ridge including Magalia and Stirling City, assemblyman Dahle said.

For businesses who sell or prepare food, additional steps are required prior to re-opening. Additionally, food facilities in the fire-affected area must schedule a routine health inspection prior to re-opening. During the inspection, they will need to verify a potable water supply. If the food facility prepares food in any way other than pre-packaged food, the facility is required to be cleaned by a commercial cleaning service before re-opening. Food facilities that only sell pre-packaged food are not required to have potable water. These facilities will be required to post a notice to the public indicating that all water sources are non-potable. Businesses and food facilities should contact Environmental Health to schedule an inspection.

There is a process in place for residents to go down the Disaster Recovery Center in Chico or in Oroville to verify residency status and to receive a placard. There are approximately 50 spaces and are on a first come, first served basis. Cal OES will also be prioritizing the cleanup of those lots. The deadline to complete right of entry forms and to register for FEMA or SBA assistance is this Friday.To date, SBA has approved over $200 million for homeowners and tenants and $10 million for businesses. Debris removal on property owners lots will not be able conducted starting today through Sunday and hoping to start on Monday, depending on weather and soil conditions according to Cal OES deputy director Eric Lamoureux. Zones that are currently being worked on are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10.

Contrary to some of the rumors, PG&E is continuing service. The base camp on Skyway is clearing out however they still have a base on Clark Road behind the ACE Hardware Store and tree crews are continuing to remove trees. They are thinking it will take the better part of a year to finish their tree work according to Aaron Johnson PG& E vice president in electric operations. To date they have removed 38,000 trees in town. For property owners who have questions on their specific trees, residents are advised to call the 800-743-5000 number and press the prompt for Camp Fire.

Although the process will take time, he ensured the people that PID is working diligently. The people are important to PID, they want to make sure they do it right, they can’t rush the process and they are taking care of it he noted. The town unanimously approved and will be putting out a request for proposals for some contract labor to assist in processing permits, plan checks, onsite inspections, engineering to name a few. “We have also been offered assistance from neighboring assistance through the California League of Cities and will also be exploring those options,” town manager Gill said.

       " 'Senator Jim Nielsen and Assemblyman James Gallagher, both if who represent Paradise, organized another bi-partisan tour of Paradise which they visited yesterday with lawmakers with help from the CA Forestry Association. The forest tour focused on forest health, vegetation management, defensible space, shaded fuel breaks, and other proven methods used to curb the risk of devastating wildfires. While en route to Paradise they heard presentations from Rich Gordon, CA Forestry Association President and CEO and Helge Eng, CalFire Deputy Director for Resource Management. The shuttle arrived at Pine Ridge School in Magalia where the group of bi-partisan lawmakers learned about a Defensible Space Project that helped protect the school during the fire. Media were there to ask questions about the level of impact of forest management, why ignition resulted after the 2008 Concow fire fuels reduction was performed and what message the fire safe council wanted to share with lawmakers. “We need equipment because the pace of hiring local crews,conservation crews, our sheriff crew, we don’t have enough physical people to get out and create enough change across the landscape in the time we need to do it,” Butte County Fire Safe Council executive director Call-Jane DeAnda said. Sen. Nielsen and assemblyman Gallagher left the group for Paradise Town Hall where they joined local leaders for an in-depth conversation with Gov. Gavin Newsom. The local group expressed appreciation for the expedited budget funding allocated to the region, but also addressed several areas where more assistance is needed. “We talked water, housing, debris removal, healthy forests, biomass, and a whole host of other issues,” Gallagher wrote in a Facebook post. The Governor and his team were attentive and took many notes about our local needs according to Gallagher. After the meeting at town hall, Nielson and Gallagher returned to Pine Ridge School where legislators, local leaders and the governor spoke to the media about a number of topics – including the expedited funding for the region. “(Yesterday) was another example of keeping the focus on the recovery effort,” Gallagher commented in a post. “Every day, I am working for funding and policy changes necessary to help people rebuild stronger and more resilient.” He added “we are all in this together!”',\n",

The last move I made, however, was involuntary, forced by the huge conflagration that took our home of some sixteen years, the longest we’d ever lived in one place. Along with tens of thousands who lost their homes (and even their hometown) to that catastrophic blaze that took the “Pleasure” out of Paradise and environs, we’ve been trying to adjust to a world in which the stove isn’t where it used to be, where the sun comes in through different windows in strange bedrooms, and where things don’t readily come to hand as they once did in more familiar surroundings. In a quote sometimes attributed to Mark Twain, “it ain’t that people are ignorant so much it is that they know so much that isn’t so.” It also turns out to be true that it ain’t so much what we don’t know so much as it is what we have to\\xa0 learn over and over again, a thought that has occurred to me quite often of late as we worked to make a new home for ourselves. Once, a long time ago, my wife designed a house we built on ten acres out in the woods up in Quincy. We tried hard to make the place perfect, custom made for our specific needs and our personalities, with a place for everything and everything in its best and proper place. Before the foundation was poured, we tried to anticipate everything. We weren’t wealthy, so we didn’t have carte blanche or a blank check. Within reason, however, we should have been able to forecast and plan for our own needs, the fulfillment of our basic desires for comfort and convenience. Alas, we didn’t entirely manage that. Although it was a most pleasant house in a place I loved, there just was no way to clearly foresee what actual day-to-day living would be like under that roof. There was a lot we got right, much that Karen planned wisely for, but it was surprising how many things we hadn’t considered, how many times we found ourselves saying “we should have…” or “we could have” done this thing or that thing once we had lived in the place for awhile and found that we would still be required to adapt to the house, even though we thought few adaptations would be necessary. We are now trying to adapt to a house that is about 500 square feet smaller than the one we lost to fire on November 8th. We’ve furnished this little rental and made it comfy. Despite our best efforts, however, it is slow to become entirely”homey” yet. Two months later, we remain in the process of adapting ourselves to the new space, getting used to where to find the paper towels, or to know without thinking just how much fiddling is required to make the water temp in the shower not too hot and not too cold. We have to look for where to plug in the vacuum cleaner, and our cats have had to adjust to a place that lacks a cat door. Then, too, three cats in a house as small as this presents its own challenges, especially since the cats’ litter boxes are no longer out in the over-sized garage we had up in Magalia. I’m not complaining, mind you. I’m just reminding myself that even if we had moved by choice, even if the house we rented was twice as big and twice as nice, we would still be finding it necessary to adjust ourselves to the new spatial arrangements that shelter us from the elements. And I say this especially for so many people in Paradise who lived in their houses far longer than we lived in ours, people who may not have had a fraction of the experience with moving and resettling that we had before we moved to the ridge. A bit of cheap advice then, for what it’s worth: Do all you can to make where you are your home, but also bear in mind that wherever we go, there we are. Whether renting, buying, or dependent upon the kindness of strangers, no matter what color the walls are painted or the unfamiliar furniture arranged, our space never really becomes ours without \\xa0the undeniable difficulties of adapting ourselves to new surroundings. Especially, perhaps, when those changes come unexpectedly and under dire duress.',\n",
       " 'CHICO\\xa0— Chico Mayor Randall Stone started his state of the city address on Friday with an apology. “I will lose it a few times during this speech, so I apologize,” Stone said. His voice grew shaky as he recalled hearing first responders on the scene of what would become the most destructive wildfire in California state history. Radio listeners could hear that some of them were forced to shelter in place. His voice wavered several times throughout the speech when describing the devastation and the impacts, but Stone also highlighted the positives that came out of the crisis. “These past three months have illustrated the most thoughtful, compassionate and genuine human kindness I have ever seen in my life,” he said. As could be expected, the Camp Fire loomed large at the State of the City and Business Summit held Friday morning at the Chico Area Recreation and Park District building. The event is co-hosted by the city and the\\xa0Chico Chamber of Commerce. Stone\\xa0was elected mayor by the City Council just over three weeks after the fire began. He used his approximately 30-minute speech to tackle hot button topics including homelessness and the local demand for housing, especially affordable housing — both issues which have been exacerbated by the fire. The next point in time survey, an effort to count every person on the street in Butte County, is scheduled for March. He said he would be in favor of a minimum 10 percent inclusionary zoning ordinance, requiring developers to dedicate at least 10 percent of their housing units in large multi-family developments for low-income housing. “Simply put, this is part of taking responsibility for Chico’s future and mandating that housing for low-income residents is set aside,” Stone said. Stone said that about 5,300 housing units were permitted and ready to be built in Chico, and he questioned what developers were waiting for. He mentioned affordable housing developments in the works, including Simplicity Village which will house veterans, three Habitat for Humanity homes expected to be ready in mid-2020 and a 100-unit affordable senior and special needs multi-family housing project expected in 2020. Stone highlighted some of the efforts of the Greater Chico Homeless Task Force, which he has chaired, including sponsoring a visit from Lloyd Pendleton, a nationally renowned homeless advocate. The mayor suggested that the city should have something similar to Project 25 in San Diego, a program he got to see in action that gets homeless people off the streets and connected with a case manager. The program has resulted in fewer hospitalizations and ambulance rides for its participants,   per participant per year. “If you want to address vagrancy issues, you can’t wish it away,” Stone said. All the sit-lie ordinance did was bring homeless people deeper into neighborhoods, he added. With regards to addressing crime, the mayor suggested getting creative and possibly funding more downtown ambassadors and social workers, instead of more cops. He noted that Chico had adequate policing levels, relative to its population size. The city just received a donation enabling the hiring of an additional officer as the population swelled after the Camp Fire. “Obviously, the needs for policing have changed since the Camp Fire, but Chico still saw a marked increase in crime and violent crime over the last four years despite that staff,” Stone said. “Without aggressive measures and outside the box thinking, the increasing crime trend will continue.” To help recoup losses resulting from the fire, the city has requested of the state $6 million per year for the next 3-5 years to backfill the city’s general fund expenses, about $1 million to backfill transient occupancy tax losses and $12 million to help manage traffic congestion, he said. “Chico’s traffic systems are presently the traffic equivalent of a clogged toilet, and we know it,” Stone said. As for new sources of revenue, the mayor spoke in favor of commercial cannabis, noting the council wanted to work with the community to develop plans, not start off by imposing regulations. He said he was still opposed to the idea of a sales tax increase, though the Chico Chamber of Commerce is recommending that the city consider a revenue measure to bolster the city’s budget for the second year in a row. Chico Chamber Board of Directors Chairwoman Michelle Niven noted that new development wouldn’t fund enough of the improvements needed in Chico, especially for road repairs and maintenance and additional law enforcement personnel in light of impacts from the Camp Fire.\\xa0No details on the type of revenue measure or amount were given at the business summit.',\n",
       " 'As the one month anniversary to the Camp Fire loomed in December of last year, the Chico Enterprise-Record looked at impacts of the fire that included the donations and help pouring into our community, re-population, the shelters (both official and unofficial) that had sprung to life seemingly overnight and, of course, the nascent plans and hopes of the community to rebuild. Months later, many of those issues are still at the forefront of recovery efforts, with ever-shifting goals and roadblocks to recovery and success. Survivors have learned to take each day as it comes, changing plans with each new challenge. Now, 100 days after the worst fire in California history, we’re revisiting those same eight topics, to evaluate where our community is in the recovery process — and just how far we have to go. At its peak, the list of missing issued by the Butte County Sheriff’s Office was more than 1,300 names long. Now, there are just the two people unaccounted for. So far, the death toll stands at 85, and the Sheriff’s Office has conclusively identified the remains of 73 people. Those names have already been released to the public, and their lives and legacies are chronicled in an ongoing project in the Enterprise-Record\\xa0— a project that aims to honor every life lost with a front page obituary. Until every last victim has been named, many feel as though the trauma of the fire continues. Though thousands of survivors have chosen to say goodbye to their homes (or what remained of them), many have also chosen to stay and rebuild. All evacuation orders in the burn scar were lifted by mid-December. Survivors who chose to return found themselves faced with a new conundrum\\xa0— to stay on their property during cleanup, or to find other accommodations until it was feasible to live there again. Very real fears of toxicity in the ashes and environment have plagued Butte County’s residents, with some in nearby cities like Oroville staging protests at the possibility of moving contaminated debris to sites in their cities for sorting and removal. Thousands of people signed up for debris removal services through the California Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the understanding that they could live on their property before and after (but not during) debris removal. That process hit a snag nearly two weeks ago when FEMA announced the town of Paradise and Butte County may not be eligible for more than $1.7 billion in reimbursement if homeowners live on debris removal-eligible property in temporary housing (but not if they’re living in a house, to the confusion and frustration of many survivors) before removal occurs. The Paradise Town Council and the Butte County Board of Supervisors scrambled to adjust emergency ordinances and to make plans for the more than 130 people who had received utility pull permits and were already living on their former properties, to the dismay and anger of hundreds who showed up to protest at a Town Council meeting in early February. The last Red Cross shelter in Butte County closed Friday at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds, where it moved in January, consolidating what was left of several official Red Cross shelters across the county. As of Tuesday, 63 RVs were still parked at the fairgrounds, and those living in them will be transitioned soon to paying a $40 daily fee to stay there, though some will be eligible for financial assistance through FEMA. The 130-plus residents who were living on debris removal-eligible properties in Paradise and unincorporated Butte County have been invited to move to one of a few dozen available spots for RVs in Oroville or at the Paradise Alliance Church at\\xa06491 Clark Road, said Shelby Boston, director of the Butte County Department of Employment and Social Services, at a recent supervisors meeting. It’s unknown how many residents will take advantage of the offer, since some will have found alternate options, Boston said. The Silver Dollar Fairgrounds is also making ready to take in 61 FEMA trailers to house evacuees, though it will not be ready for several weeks. The fair board signed an 18-month contract with FEMA effective Feb. 1 that includes a 6-month term and month-to-month extensions for up to an additional 12 months. As of today, both the Chico and Paradise Disaster Recovery Centers will be closed on weekends, staying open only Monday-Friday, in Chico from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and in Paradise from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. They are both slated to close March 1, though the Small Business Administration will open a Disaster Loan Outreach Center in both Chico and Paradise, planned for sometime in the next four to eight weeks. The last day for property owners to sign up for the government-sponsored Camp Fire debris removal program was Friday. Property owners who hire a private contractor for debris removal can sign up for the “alternative program” by completing an application and submitting a work plan to Butte County Environmental Health by Feb. 28. The SBA has also approved more than $300 million in loans for Camp Fire survivors, including $11 million for businesses and private nonprofits, and 2,452 loans totaling more than $287 million for homeowners and renters. And in January, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced his plan to allocate $305 million as part of his first state budget to expand the state’s ability to fight wildfires and better alert systems during future disasters. The North Valley Community Fund remains one of the largest, long-term recovery fundraisers. The group has distributed more than $2.2 million to community organizations serving evacuees and first responders. A recent donation of $25,000 went to the Inspire Foundation, to help cover the costs of 70 SAT and PSAT exams for affected high school students, and 100 AP exams. Other groups, such as the Fire Angels Network, the Butte Strong Fund, and Facebook groups like Paradise Fire Adopt-A-Family, continue efforts to help families and individual survivors directly with gas and gift card giveaways, tools and more. The Paradise Unified School District found sites to relocate students to in Chico, Durham, Oroville and Magalia before schools reopened in early December. Paradise Elementary students and staff are getting back to the business of education at Bird Street School in Oroville while Ponderosa Elementary students and staff have set up shop at Durham Elementary School in Durham, and the Paradise Unified school board voted unanimously in December to reopen Cedarwood Elementary School in Magalia. Oroville City Elementary School also helped out by relocating its own students, so that more than 150 students from Paradise could use the facility. In Durham, the Durham Unified School District offered nine classrooms for up to 250 Ponderosa students. 700 students from Paradise High School started school again last month at a temporary campus near the Chico municipal airport. Paradise High administrators said they hope they can return to their own campus, which mostly escaped the fire, by August. More than a dozen lawsuits had already been filed by early December against utility giant Pacific Gas & Electric that involve more than 430 plaintiffs. One of the first to file was retired Chico Police Chief Kirk Trostle and his wife, Patricia Garrison, a retired elementary principal, who are suing PG&E for negligence. A Camp Fire lawsuit on behalf of 51 people and the Paradise Community Guilds was filed against PG&E in San Francisco on Jan. 30. The Paradise Community Guilds lost its headquarters, Norton Buffalo Hall, in the fire. Most plaintiffs in these lawsuits are suing the company over damaged or destroyed property, as well as injuries sustained in the fire. PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 29. It’s hard to see daily, small steps as success in any situation, but 100 days on, Butte County has certainly made significant progress toward recovery. Paradise, Magalia, Concow, Butte Creek Canyon and the surrounding areas will never look the same way they did on Nov. 7, the day before the fire, but the indomitable spirit and determination that got the community through the first 100 days will inevitably get us through the next 100\\xa0— and the 100 after that.',\n",

In our first column we want to share the story of Paradise Fire Adopt a Family.\\xa0 When the fire broke out it was instantly shared on social media.\\xa0 My friend Brian Corr made a post of Facebook about his friend Jennifer Pruett and how her family was affected by the fire.\\xa0 Jennifer lives in Arizona.\\xa0 Nine of her family members became displaced or homeless overnight.\\xa0 I reached out to Jennifer over Facebook Messenger to offer help.\\xa0 We spoke on the phone and my wife and I agreed to “adopt her family”\\xa0 What that means is we agreed to help.\\xa0 We began to reach out directly to Jennifer’s family members to see what we could do to support them. In my business I have started a dozen or so Facebook groups.\\xa0 My wife and I thought there would be other people who would like to adopt a family so we started Paradise Fire Adopt a Family as a Facebook group.\\xa0 We thought maybe 1,000 people would join.\\xa0 The group exploded!\\xa0 The group started growing at over 1,000 people per day!\\xa0 People from all over the country (and a few all over the world) joined the group and wanted to help.\\xa0 To join the group go to\\xa0 Our concept is one family helping one family.\\xa0 We have helpers in the group and fire survivors.\\xa0 So a helper can adopt a family that was affected by the fire.\\xa0 We recommend they connect on the phone with a fire survivor to get to know each other.\\xa0 From there the helper decides to help in any way they want.\\xa0 Help might look like sending some gift cards or sending a computer they no longer need. In some cases helpers have purchased trailers for families or gifted them an extra car.\\xa0 Everything adds up no matter how big or small.\\xa0 Helpers can also post support they can offer.\\xa0 Michelle Savoy, a helper, recently made this post: I have a few of my handmade toys that I would love to give to some fire survivor kids who have birthdays coming up. Comment on the photo you like, saying who it’s for and their age and birthday.

Any chance someone has the colorful divided plates. And the small bowls and they don’t want them or have outgrown them???? It’s a comfort and/or memory thing we would love to have back in our lives. One great thing about the Facebook group is it connects those in need with those that need help.\\xa0 I think this resonates with a lot of people because they can get the help directly to those that need it. So here is a helicopter view of where things stand from our prospecting.\\xa0 Many fire survivors have found a new place to live.\\xa0 They have rented an apartment or home.\\xa0 Some have moved to other areas of Northern California.\\xa0 Some have moved to nearby states like Nevada, Oregon or Arizona.\\xa0 Thousands of people through are still displaced.\\xa0 There are people living in shelters.\\xa0 There are people living with people who have opened up their homes.\\xa0 There are several thousand people living in trailers.\\xa0 Many of these trailers have leaks in the roof and has been raining quite a bit.\\xa0 Many people do not have a good working vehicle.\\xa0 Many don’t have jobs so they have no income.

       " 'PARADISE — In the hundred days since the Camp Fire sparked and ripped through Paradise, destroying thousands of homes and displacing thousands of residents, the town’s police department has confronted a new normal. “The dynamic has changed for policing a town that, I wouldn’t say no longer exists, but it’s different,” Paradise Police Chief Eric Reinbold said. He added: “Some of the officers have made it a project to go out and welcome businesses back into the community. They go and talk to people that are either on their property or have moved back in just to welcome them back, talk to them, let them know we’re still here.” Since the state’s deadliest and most destructive wildfire broke out Nov. 8, the Police Department has embraced new opportunities to connect with its rebuilding community and confronted new challenges within its ranks. “The goal that I’ve been promoting is to be more community oriented now that we have the time,” Reinbold said. “Let’s go out and talk to people, because they’re going to be our allies. They’re going to be the ones telling us what their concerns are and what’s going on. And so it’s a way to build new relationships.” Officers have more time on their hands because calls for police service in the town have plummeted, the police chief said. Officers no longer have a constant stream of calls to respond to, such as domestic violence incidents, traffic accidents and shoplifting cases. During the nighttime hours, calls for service are almost non-existent. “There’s nobody on the road,” Reinbold said, noting a local curfew remains in effect. “It’s really hard to be proactive, and so I can’t imagine what the officers are going through, working nights. It’s almost like they’ve lost a purpose in a sense when they’re not able to find bad guys to arrest. They’re not answering calls, so in that respect, it’s … a pretty lonely place up here at night.” The Police Department’s building on Black Olive Drive was spared by the fire’s fast-moving flames, but many of its personnel were not so fortunate. Reinbold, who lost his home in the fire, said 18 paid department employees lost their homes as well.           In the coming months, the police chief said the department expects six of its 15 patrol officers to depart, leaving behind a scheduling puzzle that has yet to be solved. Further, without a clear understanding of the department’s funding going forward, recruiting officers to backfill vacant positions will be difficult. It’s possible, he said, that the department could lose six officers and not rehire all six. But officials do not want to operate under a certain number of officers for several reasons, including burnout, safety and overtime considerations. Asked if there is a concern the Police Department could be dissolved, Reinbold said that has not been an option that has been discussed. “I will say that everything that the town is doing is contingent upon stable, continued funding,” he said. “Whether that’s the Police Department, the building department, any of it. So, I can’t tell you for sure that it wouldn’t happen, but it will be interesting to see what happens six months from today.” Town officials, he said, are aiming to keep the staff the department had before the fire, because the department had already been “understaffed,” the police chief said, adding that he’s heard people voice concerns over a county takeover of the Police Department. “I’ve had people directly tell me, Look, if we don’t have a police department, we’re not going to rebuild, because we appreciate the police services we get,” Reinbold said. “No disrespect to the county, but it’s different … It’s a different dynamic, no matter if you’re in Butte County or another county. Sheriff’s offices and police departments are different.” Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea spends a lot of time thinking about disaster response, management and preparedness. Following the Oroville Dam spillway crisis in 2017, and then the Camp Fire last year, the sheriff has come to believe there is a need for a unified statewide system for notifying people of emergencies. Honea, in a recent interview, said he is an advocate of finding consistent language, from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and agency to agency, regarding mass notifications, such as warning people of evacuations and evacuation warnings. A statewide system, he said, also must be able to uniformly communicate to people on multiple platforms, including traditional media, social media and push notifications to cellphones, among other platforms. There also must be a component that is not reliant on technology, because technology can fail during emergencies. And the sheriff said there is a need to “manage the public’s expectations” regarding what can be done during so-called “no-notice events” such as the Camp Fire, whose flames ate up dry vegetation and were propelled by high winds. As entire communities tried to escape the Camp Fire at once, roadways became jammed, leaving some people trapped in their cars and others running for their lives. Honea said there needs to be a backup plan in such “no-notice” events. “The backup is some ability to shelter those people safely in place, and if that means we designate locations that we … clear the brush and you have signs that tell people what to do, maybe that’s what we need to do,” he said. Among the Sheriff’s Office’s duties in the months following the fire has been the recovery and identification of people who died in the blaze. So far, the death toll stands at 85, and the Sheriff’s Office has conclusively identified the remains of 73 people. Of the 12 people remaining, 10 have been tentatively identified, and DNA confirmation is pending, Honea said. The identification process for the last two people will be more difficult. Investigators don’t have clear circumstantial evidence that could lead to their identification, and DNA, so far, is only available for one set of remains. But without familial DNA to compare with, the Sheriff’s Office is looking into going through a genealogy service to find clues that could uncover possible family members of the deceased. The search and recovery of remains involved nearly 10,000 personnel, with resources from throughout California and several other states. The sheriff said the effort will likely inform the way mass casualty incidents are handled across the country. One hundred days later, Honea said it’s hard to remember what life was like before the fire. “It’s a changed world,” he said. “Everybody knows that the world can change in an instant. You know that from an abstract concept. But until you’ve been through it and you see how the world changes instantly, it’s hard to really understand. And the world changed for all of us on Nov. 8.” Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey said Friday his office’s investigation into the Camp Fire is “very much active.” Cal Fire has not released the cause of the fire. PG&E has come under scrutiny for the blaze, which sparked under power lines near Pulga. And the utility is facing multiple lawsuits alleging its equipment caused the fire. Ramsey said PG&E is the subject of a criminal investigation, which is being conducted to determine whether charges will be brought. No other entity is being investigated. The district attorney declined to comment on whether he believed PG&E’s equipment caused the fire. He said his office is gathering additional law enforcement partners in the probe, but there is no time frame regarding when the investigation could be completed.',\n",
       " 'PARADISE — In the midst of the charred and twisted remains of Paradise, 12 faces of hope grace unexpected canvases of half walls, crumbling chimneys and skeletons of burnt vehicles. The murals rise from the ash and rubble of the most destructive wildfire in California history, reminders that there still is beauty in this devastated town and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Like “everybody else” Shane Grammer, a Chico native who now lives with his wife Missy and their three daughters in Los Angeles, heard about the fire on the news and “like everybody else didn’t think much about it other than, ‘there’s another fire.’” It wasn’t until pictures and videos taken by those escaping and then by those returning including, friends he’d grown up with, began appearing on social media platforms that Grammer said “the scope, the full impact” of the event hit him.           “I’ve always had a heart to bring hope and joy to the downcast and broken hearted through my art so this has been a theme in my life,” said Grammer. A freelance artist who primarily works in the theme park industry, Grammer has traveled the world using his skills as a street artist to paint images of inspiration in inner city and poverty-stricken, crime-ridden or ravaged communities in San Francisco, Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Cambodia. It was “emotionally conflicting” for Grammer to see the devastation of the Camp Fire and the possibility in its aftermath simultaneously. “I’m a street artist at heart. I love painting on crazy surfaces — alleyway walls, under bridges — with permission of course. When I saw burnt cars and chimneys my street artist side took over. I saw both great canvases and a way to bring beauty to into the wreckage,” said Grammer. When old friends, Shane and Jennifer Edwards, posted a photo of their destroyed home on Clark Road the artist reached out and asked if he could paint a mural on the only thing left standing, their chimney. The Edwards said yes. The mural, which originally was the only one Grammer intended to paint, was inspired by an on-going series the artist is working on called “The Bride,” based on the love story “Song of Solomon” from the Old Testament. “She’s not a bride in the traditional sense. She’s a representation of the allegory that story teaches us. God is the king and the bride represents mankind. The mural is meant to remind us that God is passionately in love with us and always with us,” said Grammer. Grammer returned home after finishing the painting but images of the mural, called by those posting it “Beauty Among the Ashes,” went viral. Through the comments posted, Grammer knew he had accomplished what he set out to do “bring hope and joy” to the people of Paradise. “People said when they came around the corner and saw it, it was like ‘a slap of beauty’ in their face,” he said. The response to the mural was so profound Missy told him he needed to go back to Paradise and paint more. Grammer gave a shout out on Facebook asking if others would allow him to paint on their property. The response was immediate. Grammer ultimately made two weeklong trips to Paradise. A Sacramento client,  , offered to cover his expenses and provide photographer Terence Duffy to document the work. Armed with “cans and cans” of Montana 94 transparent spray paint, Grammer worked in heavy clothing and combat boots among the ashes, ultimately creating a dozen murals that span the area from lower Clark Road to the Magalia border and down the Skyway to Pearson Road. With the exception of a large wooden cross there wasn’t much left of Hope Christian Church on Pentz Road but Jeana Darby, worship leader and ministry director, told Grammer if he could find a “canvas” in the debris he was welcome to paint on the property. Grammer selected the husk of the cement baptismal. “I was baptized in that baptismal. So were my brother, my husband and my best friend. Everything is in utter ruin around it and then there’s this inspiring portrait of Jesus.\\xa0 When I saw it, it took my breath away. It’s a very encouraging and uplifting reminder that in this pile of rubbish, in this tragedy Jesus is in the middle of it with us and we are not alone,” said Darby. Among the dozen murals there are only two portraits of Paradise residents. On Glen Drive the face of a young girl, Eleanor, is painted on the partial remains of her family’s lost home. In the portrait Eleanor’s chin is lifted and her gaze is raised toward the sky. “When the picture was taken, she was facing the front window and looking up at tree that boomed purple every spring. It was her favorite spot. It’s almost like Eleanor is looking at that tree in the mural even though there’s only a charred, black stump left,” said Grammer. On the only wall left standing of his former Sunday school teacher and basketball coach, Gary Drews’ home, Grammer painted a portrait of Drews’ mother-in-law,  , who perished in her own home in the Camp Fire. “I was amazed, almost speechless when I saw the photograph of the wonderful work Shane did. I don’t think the mural will stay forever but I’m glad he did it. She has such a wondering, questioning expression. It’s a very good depiction,” said Suzanne Drews, Pace’s daughter. Grammer said the Paradise mural project was both “emotionally draining and uplifting.” And while he knows as a street artist that his work is transitory, that all the “canvases” in Paradise could be torn down at any moment, he hopes the “beauty, hope and little bit of joy” they brought to people’s hearts remain indelible.',\n",
       " 'Starting Wednesday morning, motorists should expect around-the-clock one-way traffic control this week at the intersection of State Highway 191 (Clark Road) and Durham-Pentz Road near Butte College. The reversing one-way traffic control, which will occur from all directions on the highway and Durham-Pentz Road, is scheduled to start at 7 a.m. Wednesday, February 20 and continue through Sunday, February 24. Cal Trans said that it and its contractor Knife River Construction will be building a roundabout at the intersection as part of an emergency project related to Camp Fire recovery efforts. It’s expected that the state’s largest debris removal effort underway in Paradise will increase truck traffic on Highway 191. Offcials say that the roundabout is designed to move traffic through the intersection more quickly and with less congestion on approaching roads. Instead of stopping, motorists yield to vehicles in the traffic circle. This allows the intersection to handle more traffic in the same amount of time. Offcials are advising drivers to allow additional travel time during the peak morning and afternoon commute hour. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0',\n",
       " 'The first of series of listening sessions for the town to share ideas and a vision for rebuilding Paradise is this Friday at Paradise Alliance Church. Residents are \\xa0invited to attend the workshop along with Barry Long of Urban Design Associates, a long-term planning consultant to collaborate on the vision for the community. The meeting will begin with a brief overview of the planning process and schedule of upcoming meetings. Following after, participants will break out into small groups to discuss ideas for the future of Paradise. Those small groups will report back to the large group and bring the meeting to a close. Prior to the public workshop, Mayor Jody Jones met with Congressman Doug LaMalfa’s office and representatives from USDA on the septic system on Feb. 13. The federal agencies had some ideas on how the town would be able to get money to do the engineering work, mayor Jones said. Currently they are following up at the present time. There are funding sources available as Paradise rebuilds, she noted. In total to get a sewer in town for the business district along Skyway, \\xa0Pearson Road and Clark Road it would be an $80 million project. The next step is to get between $5 and $10 million for engineering of the sewer, according to Jones. “As long as we’re rebuilding the infrastructure of the town let’s build it back better,” chief of staff for congressman Doug LaMalfa Mark Spannagel said. “We are working on the recovery and rebuilding efforts every day,” he noted. “This is all hands on deck process.” He noted the office of Doug LaMalfa representatives met with FEMA earlier today. USDA is sending resources to Paradise to help complete the planning process according to Spannagel. A meeting with the federal representatives has not been scheduled yet for follow up on the sewer project. “We are going to be taking public comments on the the project at the planning meeting public workshop on Friday at Paradise CMA church,” she said. The public workshop is Friday, Feb. 22 from 10 a.m. to noon inside the sanctuary at Paradise Alliance Church located at 6491 Clark Road.',\n",
       " 'Kevin Atlas, the first one-armed person to receive Division I basketball scholarship, made his first stop at Paradise High School today as part of his 300 appearance nonstop tour to challenge students, administrators and teachers to believe in themselves. Along with visiting PHS and 300 -plus schools on the tour, the campaign encourages faculty and students at schools across the country to use the hashtag #BelieveInYouChallenge on social media to share their own examples of attending school events they never have before. Atlas, 6-foot-11-inches tall with his arm discontinued below his elbow was born and raised in Pleasanton, grew up in a split custody household, overcame the death of his father, was not able to read until the third grade with ADHD and dyslexia. He has shared his story of overcoming adversity on six continents and across 49 states. Atlas became one of the top high school basketball players in his home state, in his senior year of high school he met President George W. Bush and broke his leg — on the same day which cost him his scholarship. That put him on a path to Virginia to regain the scholarships. He played one post graduate year at military school in Virginia and and earned a full athletic scholarship to join the Manhattan College Jaspers in New York City. Atlas achieved becoming the first disabled player in NCAA history to receive a Division I athletic scholarship. He said his AAU coach in his home state taught Atlas to believe in himself which had the most impact on his life and was his mentor. “At Paradise High School all of the faculty, all of the students what they have done is courageous and we want to duplicate this school and how it came together with the hashtag #BelieveInYouChallenge,” Atlas noted. At the school rally he shared his personal story of not making the basketball team as the world told him he was not good enough and could not achieve much. His visit to the high school at 1000 Fortress Street in Chico is the first school on his nationwide tour and social media campaign empowering people to support one another. Atlas is the host of the Believe in You Challenge video series that has already been shown in classrooms of high school students. It is the most powerful series to be distributed nationwide with varsity brands he noted. The #BelieveInYouChallenge and Atlas’ tour will come to life with coordination of the three divisions BSN SPORTS, Herff Jones and Varsity Spirit. Atlas said he learned to speak from the heart to connect with children,\\xa0 to let one’s guard down and to show them love is the best way to empower and elevate them. “I hate being called a speaker because that’s not what I do,” Atlas said. “I hate key notes or running assemblies, I get real with kids, I’m a life coach to them and they need somebody.” Not everyone is blessed to have a great home situation or mentor in their lives to give them what coaches and teachers have done for him he noted. “I love motivating and inspiring other people in a real and gritty way, I was out there playing Superman trying to solve problems… I did make an impact but to partner with varsity brands who has representatives in every school in the country that’s an army,” he said. “We’re the Justice League or the Avengers, it’s an army of people making change not just me.” This movement is an attempt to nationally fix problems including children not feeling appreciated, children facing depression and anxiety and the school shootings and suicides statistics are growing according to Atlas. The hope of the Believe in You Challenge is to inject acceptance, love and kindness and creating a support system he noted. Grace Hedman, 10th grade student at Paradise High School said it was inspirational when Atlas shared putting on mask because she said she has done that before to hide what does not want to be shown. “I didn’t expect his backstory to be the way it was,” Hedman said. The message she said she took away from his motivational speech is to not hide herself, to be more confident, be more social, and be a leader instead of a follower. Atlas talking about the Camp Fire is helping her move forward she noted. “I’m still making (adjustments being at the fortress school site) because I lost my house, I was stuck in a motel for a month, farther away from the school,” Hedman said. “When we came back to the warehouse and it was new you had to make adjustments.” Braden Gonzalez, ninth grade student at Paradise High School attended the rally. “When (Kevin Atlas) said he got D(ivision) I with one hand it was weird because you wouldn’t think that someone with one hand would be able to play that good,” he commented. How Atlas said he uses it as an advantage and not a disadvantage is really inspiring Gonzalez said. ”It helps me because it shows I can’t make an excuse when I go to baseball, oh my arm hurts I know I don’t have an excuse I can just go through it,” he noted. It is inspiration for the sports he plays because it shows if Atlas can do it with one hand he can do it with everything. “You have to work hard,” Gonzalez added. Select schools make visits at for students posted their experiences. The process is to create school spirit environment where children are surrounded by love, kindness, acceptance and appreciation. That environment will change your high school experience.',\n",
       " 'The Paradise Unified School District approved several employee agreements at the board of trustees meeting Tuesday night including a tentative agreement with Teachers’ Association of Paradise, an amendment for PUSD superintendent Michelle John’s employment and amendment to the assistant superintendent of Human Resources Tom Taylor’s employment. It unanimously approved the mediator’s tentative agreement with Teachers’ Association of Paradise that results in a 1.5 percent salary increase for employees hired on July 1. The deal also means that teachers with only emergency, intern or career technical education credentials will be paid $36,000. This agreement is in effect until June 30,2020. Mike O’Conner, Paradise Intermediate School teacher spoke to the board and mentioned the administrative raises, asserting that some people were not happy about administrators getting raises. “I want to speak for myself, you (all) deserve it. At the same time, if it’s at the 1.5 percent amount that’s the amount that’s in the tentative agreement from the previous year which we went to impasse for,” he said. \\xa0“I don’t know how many times we met, five to six times before the one and a half percent( increase).” O’Connell also asserted that a classified staff member told him Tuesday they were frustrated about the raise. He spoke on the staff member’s behalf, claiming administrative raises could have paid for lower level employee to receive either more help or support in their position. “More than just retirements and more than losing a few staff, my fear is that we might be losing a lot more people than we think we’re going to lose,” he said.”What a tragic thing that would be with a staffing ratio of 11 to 1 what if we have to go out and hire and recruit people to come here when we already know our pay is below surrounding districts.” It’s an unknown he added. “We have, possibly, three years of funding to look at and those are difficult to look at. But it’s just around the corner when other districts start saying it’s time to start hiring,” he said. “ My fear is Paradise unified becomes this vacuum where people leave and if there’s a way to incentivize people to stay that would be in everyone’s best interest.” The district approved the employee agreement with superintendent Michelle John agreeing the for the district to pay John an annual salary of $162,400 beginning on Feb. 19. Tom Taylor, PUSD assistant superintendent of Human Resources reported on the Sunshine Proposal for the previous school year and the current 2018-2019 school year with California School Employee Association. Sunshine Proposal for 2017-2018 comprises a list of negotiations including district rights, personnel files, filling of vacancies and administrative transfers, layoffs, leaves, pay and allowances. The district approved the Sunshine Proposal. Also, approved at the board meeting was agreements with administrators, classified managers, the employment agreement with Tom Taylor, assistant superintendent of Human Resources and employment agreement with David McCready, assistant superintendent of Business Services. According to Local Control Accountability Plan update presented by superintendent Michelle John, a report of students from Nov. 2018 to Jan 2019 shows kindergarten dropped to 135 students, grades first through fifth lost 631 students, sixth through eighth lost 336 students and 9th through 12th grade has lost 360 students. \\xa0 \\xa0 “We are about 52 percent of our current enrollment,” she said. “We have lost eight teachers in January and the number could have changed in the last couple of weeks,” according to John. The district has lost four classified members and are down to 11 to 1 student to teacher ratio. The district is working with two different air quality companies at Pine Ridge School and Cedarwood Elementary School, one at Paradise High School. John said there will be 24 hour air quality monitors every day at each site. Cal OES and FEMA told John that they expect no debris in the air. The benzene levels in the water are not a problem except for around the Lancaster area she noted. John said the district will hire their own soil experts to test the soil because Cal OES does not test the schools’ fields. \\xa0 \\xa0 John told the trustees that the timeline of students returning Paradise schools on ridge is to still unknown.. “We know that Ponderosa Elementary School will not be ready next year, it is a possibility that Paradise Intermediate School can hold transitional kindergarten through sixth grade, we’re planning for Paradise High School and Paradise eLearning Academy and, at this time, we do not have any students at Honey Run Academy,” John said. “We’re looking at 1,500 students with four campuses that can hold the 1,500 students while teachers work next year to plan for a strategic rebuilding and getting our students back,” John added. PUSD currently has 1,924 students.',\n",
       " 'Paradise Irrigation District Vice President Anne Rice’s resignation was accepted effective yesterday by the board. Rice, who was not present, resigned for health reasons. Her position as board vice president was filled by Division 5 Director Bob Prevot who was elected unanimously on a motion by Division 2 Director Bill Kellogg. Bill Kellogg also motioned to keep the same voting system in place when the board filled Dan Wentland’s seat with Division I Director Dan Hansen at the meeting in January. In addition to accepting Rice’s resignation, the board also authorized an agreement for arborist’s services related to the Camp Fire to not exceed an amount of $26,880, subject to legal counsel. Firestorm Wildland Fire Suppression Inc., out of Chico is the arborist the board chose. As part of the Camp Fire recovery effort, the district had issued a request for proposal for removing hazardous trees from the roadway right-of-way and public trails. The district is requiring assistance evaluating which trees are hazardous, or have hazardous limbs as defined by FEMA in the district right-of-way and on private property that threaten the district’s right-of-way. The board voted 3 to 1 to contract with Firestorm, Kellogg was the sole opposing vote. PID representative Jim Landrini spoke on water testing at customers’ properties at the meeting. A question was asked from the audience if it is a good idea for property owners to not have water turned on for any use until it is known that the water is clean at their home so contamination does not leak into neighboring properties. Landrini resounded by saying it is personal choice and that it is the infrastructure that is contaminated, not the water that leeches into a neighboring service line. “Depending on the water dynamics at any given time that water can be moving and it could move it from a contaminated service line over to the next service line and when they activated that water (in the Lancaster Drive area) it could do that,” he said.”We know we have contaminated and non-contaminated service lines. Now we’re digging into the water mains.” He added there are different plumbing inside a property owner’s home and to exercise caution in sampling water. Camp Fire Timber & Biomass Removal Project for Hazardous Fuels Reduction was next on the agenda to speak at the meeting by Butte County Fire Safe Council treasurer Jim Broshears. The council is taking on the project to find the organizations to harvest timber and the grants to support the project. Butte County Fire Safe Council approached PID\\xa0 with an opportunity to partner with them. The project would start at PID’s treatment plant and go up into the burn area of Magalia. The pilot project will be apart of Paradise Pines Property Owners Association, Paradise Park and Recreation District and also private areas in Paradise and Magalia according to Broshears. The money from trees that have value is used to run the program and for to restoration of the forest. “From the time we take over the operation and on your timber, prep it for sale, put it to sale, harvest it, take it to mill, receive funding, buy trees and reforest that is the nutshell version of the program we are offering (PID), he said. “The reason that homes can’t jump into this right away is we can’t be removing timber off of parcels that have not had their debris removal done.” Broshears said the council hopes the project works and are able to help private home owners remove timber from their property. The goal is to get up to 30 truckloads of timber out per day. The board approved a memorandum of understanding with the fire safe council subject to legal review. Kellogg spoke about water service for homeowners with travel trailers on their property at the meeting.\\xa0 PID manager Kevin Phillips said that the majority of the contaminants being found are within burnt structures. “While we’re developing this plan to isolate contaminants a lot of (the issues are) getting people off of the water system. What we’re looking at is getting them off of the system and getting them their own water supply so that the system is stagnant and isolated,” Phillips said. “I know people want water service and we want to give it to them but at this point it could be counter-productive to the system getting up and running and getting the contaminants isolated within the system.” Division I Director Dan Hansen noted some of the challenges are going to take discovery. “I had kicked around about putting up a faucet on my property so that I could use water,” Hansen said.” But knowing what I learned (at the meeting) from Jim (Landrini) it’s I could possibly contaminate my neighbors’ water if I hook up to my motor-home on my property.”',\n",
       " 'I didn’t know what to expect. I had signed up to be a volunteer with Alta Archaeology Consulting, and even though I had read the emails and the detailed explanation of where we were going and what we would be looking for, it hadn’t quite registered. I didn’t truly understand until I was standing there on Friday morning staring at pictures tucked into plastic binder sleeves as they were passed around to the other volunteers. We would be looking for previously cremated remains that had been left behind during the evacuation. Each volunteer team of archaeologists was paired with a dog and handler from the Institute for Canine Forensics. Our handler was Lynne Englebert. Her dog was a border collie named Piper. We donned Tyvek suits, the big chunky white hazmat suits I’d seen in photos, piled our gear into the car of one of our volunteers, and set off towards Paradise. It rained on us. It sleeted on us. One team was snowed on. But we kept digging, searching through the charred remains of what was once people’s homes. We were looking for a very distinct pile of ashes among an even larger pile of ashes. When a person is cremated their bones are left behind, and are later ground down and mixed in with the ashes that remain. During the cremation process there is usually a small metal medallion about the size of a quarter that is added to the body. This helps to identify the remains after cremation. These cremains are then stored in a variety of containers, depending on the family’s wishes. Some families stored the cremains in a plastic bag tucked inside a velvet pouch. Others were kept inside of ceramic urns. Some were in a simple box they had been given from the crematorium. All had been left behind during the chaotic evacuation several months before. When the fire came through the cremains essentially went through a second burn, which changed their color. What was once a light to dark gray transformed into a yellow or peach. Once a potential sample had been identified the easiest way to confirm if it was a set of cremains was to take a little bit in our hands and rub it between our fingers. Cremains are gritty like beach sand. Building material looked solid but was slick and disgusting, and it smeared like oil and grease. Some individuals were easier to recover than others. One family had kept two sets of cremains on the bottom shelf of a wooden buffet. When the fire burned through the house, the cremains fell through the buffet and dropped a few inches to the floor. They were mostly intact, had burned to two distinct colors, and the medallions easily identified each individual. Another family had a set of cremains that had fallen in three different directions. I don’t know how they were stored before the fire, but when their trailer had burned the cremains hit a bottom support beam and scattered. Hope said it looked like an explosion had happened. We were digging next to a retaining wall, underneath were a bedroom used to be. When the house had still been standing the bedroom shared a wall with the garage and the kitchen. While we cleared away the larger pieces we found broken dishes adorned with Disney characters mixed in among what was probably once a motorcycle. “This doesn’t make sense,” Hope repeated. Piper had alerted next to a nearby footing. I assume it was once where a column had stood, supporting the house as part of it extended over a gently sloping hill. We continued to dig, speculating how furniture might have shifted as it burned, where items might have dropped as the floor gave way and fell to the ground beneath it. “Where were the dishes stored?” we asked. “Where was the bed in relation to the rest of the room? These look like knobs; were they attached to the kitchen cabinets or to a dresser?” Our client paused with each question, and her eyes lost focus as she stared off into the distance while her hands traced over a space that now only existed in her memories. We were an hour late getting to our next house. “Please take your time,” Lynne told us our next client had said. “If it was me, I’d want you to stay until you found them.” We continued to dig. Lynne divided her time between talking with our client and doing a visual survey of where the house once stood. Looking across the fenced-in yard she paused, then called to another member of our team. “Chris, can you go over there and tell me if that’s a planter or part of a propane tank?” Lynne asked as she pointed at an object that had been stopped by the chain-link fence in the distance. “It’s a propane tank,” Chris called back. “It looks like it’s missing the top quarter of it.” We had found our explosion. There was a small pocket of cremains that Joanne and Lynne had identified. We bagged what we had, then explained to our client in detail about what we had found, the way the kitchen and garage were mixed in with the bedroom and how we thought the explosion of the propane tank inside the garage had caused her loved one’s remains to scatter. It was bad luck piled on top of bad luck. Our last site of the day had a number of things going against it. Our client hadn’t actually been inside of the structure before it burned down. Her mother’s cremains were inside somewhere, but she wasn’t sure where. It had been windy, and strong gusts had likely scattered what was exposed. Everything had been exposed. Before we started that morning, Lynne had told the gathered volunteers to make sure to check all six directions: north, south, east, west, up and down. The day before we could hear loud popping as trees were felled in the distance. Today we watched as burnt husks of trees swayed ominously above our heads. “If you hear a crack, run,” Lynne told us. I looked up at the trees and told myself if we heard a crack then it was probably already too late. Piper had alerted in two different areas. We split our team in half and began to dig. One person checked all the metal fixtures, opening and peering into a filing cabinet and a tool rack. As other teams finished they joined us at our site. When the rain began to fall, archaeologists peeled away to hold umbrellas for those still digging. After an hour we had cleared the entire floor. We could only recover a handful of cremains, what one volunteer had called a memorial sample. When it was presented to our client she cried with joy. What had felt like a failure to us, was for her a peace of mind she didn’t think she would ever recover. The last day “You might want to pull the zipper up to your waist before you tie the arms around you,” Lisa said as she pointed at the way I was half in and half out of my Tyvek suit. “It looks like you’re not wearing any pants.” “I’m not,” I blurted out. Lisa started laughing. “Oh, it’s one of those kinds of days.” We were all tired. This was the last day of the recovery effort. During the morning briefing there were plenty of snarky comments and laughter among the volunteers. We were eager to get to our work. The site my team had been sent to had two homes on the property. We were looking for cremains in both homes. I was the site photographer, so I spent my time bouncing between the two areas, documenting the recovery process. Piper had finished working and was spending the rest of the day playing with a little girl, a family member of our client. Each time I passed them Piper would stop playing and stare at me. “You know what she’s thinking, right?” Lynne asked me with a sly smile. “She’s thinking, ‘You smell really dead for a living person.’” My human nose couldn’t pick up the scent that had attached itself to me as I worked close to several sets of cremains. When it was time for us to go we were still searching for one final set. We had ru n out of time, and we were no closer to finding the last individual than when we had started. It had been a hard burn, with downed power lines and a downed transformer sitting at the corner of where the home had stood. A family member had come by after the fire and sifted through the ashes looking for keepsakes. More than likely the cremains had been disturbed, and now we couldn’t find them. When the weekend wrapped up my team had been to eight homes and recovered 13 sets of cremains. We had only missed one. There had been five rotations. Volunteer archaeologists and canine teams had put in more than 3,872 hours. We had recovered 210 sets of cremains from 178 homes. We had missed 29. The staff at Alta Archaeology Consulting began doing cremains recovery after the Tubbs Fire burned through their backyard in Santa Rosa. So far they’ve worked four wildfires in California since Nov. 2017: the Tubbs Fire, the Carr Fire in Shasta County, the Woolsey Fire in LA County, and the Camp Fire. Alex DeGeorgey, one of the principal members of the company, said their overall success rate has been incredibly high at 88 percent recovery. Sometimes full sets of cremains were recovered, about eight pounds of ashes. Other times, a “keepsake” sample of about a teaspoon was all that could be found. Their goal is to make human cremains recovery part of the standard procedures during a natural disaster. DeGeorgey says this is our new normal, and hopes to use the information gathered during the Paradise recovery effort to further that goal. But the effects within the community are much more immediate. A lady stopped me while I was filling up my water bottle at Burger King to thank me for my service. A group of chaplains prayed over us at Starbucks. A Native American gentlemen went out of his way to bless Piper so she could continue her important work. Some people had lost everything. On our second day Lynne had told me that the thought of their loved ones spending eternity in a toxic waste dump mixed in with their burnt down homes was the worst thing they could imagine. “We’re saving them from that nightmare,” she said.',\n",
       " 'Jocelyn Cronin, from Petaluma who volunteered during the 2017 Santa Rosa fires had started the Camp Fire Campaign Propane to help survivors in Chico. A propane giveaway of 90 to 115 propane tanks was organized on Thursday by Cronin with Camp Fire survivor Stephen Murray. With survivors living in trailers and the cold weather at night she did not want the survivors to be freezing, she said. Cronin planned to buy new propane tanks because the trailers that survivors are living in have out of date tanks. She bought 25 tanks at $30 each in Santa Rosa and her friend Angela DeCarli of DeCarli’s Propane is filled the propane tanks for free. She reached out to survivors on Facebook and hand delivered propane tanks to survivors homes from Oroville to Corning as well as Magalia, Paradise and Chico. Cronin partnered with\\xa0 Murray for the Campaign Propane event for Camp Fire Survivors’ seniors who do not have social media. She brought 25 tanks from Petaluma to Chico on Thursday. Cronin handed out the tanks to survivors on Thursday morning and refilled the tanks at Tractor Supply Company to give away. Stephen Murray, helped give out $12,000 to $13,000 worth of donations at the propane giveaway including gift cards for food/gas and household items. “I knew that there was at least 150 people needing help and we heard about 228 people. If it’s a couple or a mom with kids, we had carloads of people coming,” he said.” It feels good to give back to the people that are in dire need of \\xa0anything. It doesn’t matter if its $20.” People waited an hour this morning just for a gas card that’s $20 he noted. A lot of people that came yesterday didn’t leave they just hung out and watched it all unfold he added. “And this is good for me after 31 years and living in Paradise and losing everything, losing my job. I volunteer but this is kind of my job,” he said. “I just like to take care of people.” Murray worked in Paradise before the fire as a maintenance manager at a mobile home park. He said he is living in an RV in Corning with his fiancé\\xa0and two children ages two and four-months old. He brought 18 propane tanks with him to Chico which were all given away and 20 more were being brought in to give to Camp Fire survivors. “This is just the beginning, we’re going to start getting a lot of big (propane) tanks, we need seven gallon tanks, 10 gallon tanks, I just got a 50 gallon tank today donated,” he said. “If we can keep donations going the propane problem can be solved.” Murray said when you can help 150 families in one day that’s the best way to get the word out. Julie Peterson, who grew up in Redding drove down to Chico from Washington to volunteer for the giveaway. Peterson was a volunteer after the Carr Fire in August which started her volunteer efforts to help Camp Fire survivors. She brought donations down from Washington that she packed in her Honda she noted. “The (survivors) are lost, there is so many levels of pain that they are going through and to come here at different times and also be an outsider and see what’s going on here. I can see the different levels of pain and frustration,” she said. “When people reach out to them they feel loved and I feel like that’s what they need.” Peterson talked to a person yesterday when she was volunteering at Samaritan’s Purse and the person’s friend said it wasn’t digging through the ash and finding things ( on their property) it was more about the compassion, love and humanity( the survivors receive). That’s what is bringing her back she noted. “The survivors are so thankful for that,” she said.” Even though the survivors are frustrated and having problems in different areas, they love the fact that everyone is coming to help and they are in awe. They are in awe like we are in awe.” Rebecca Portlock, 64-years-old from Paradise, is living in a fifth-wheel trailer with her two dogs on a lot near the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds in Chico. She attended the propane giveaway with her son Carey Wrobel, 44-years-old. Portlock said receiving the propane tank costs her less money to live because it costs money to fill up the propane tanks. “That is a little extra I’ll have in my pocket for something else,” she noted. The donations that were given away said it makes her feel like they have not been forgotten. “I lost a house that I just bought it in April and I paid cash. I didn’t have insurance and I’m not going to get it back,” Portlock said.” These little things are a reminders that they still care and remember us.” Her and her son were living in a fifth wheel for three weeks with no water or electricity, then to a friend’s RV with electricity but no shower, they then stay at a motel and bought a trailer with the FEMA money and moved into a lot. Portlock said she will move back to her property with her RV when she is allowed to move back and she plans to buy a modular home in a couple years. Both are renting a lot they are currently living on with three adults and three children. Wrobel is getting counseling because he is suffering from PTSD he said. They both went to the Camp Fire Celebration of Life memorial to get closure on what happened during and after the fire. “I”m going to counseling once a week now and talking to someone about this because it’s been a very traumatic (experience) for me,” he said as he was crying. Portlock said it has been traumatic for her too. “It made an impact on my life that it won’t ever be the same again,” she said as she was crying. “But God will get us through it.” She is also attending counseling to help her with moving forward she noted. Kailey Elliot, 31 years-old from Paradise is housing Mandi Moon, 39-years-old, a single mother of six children in Chico. Moon from Utah is living in a 19-foot trailer for the last three months in Chico. She was living in her Suburban until she received a trailer last week. Moon attended the Campaign Propane event with her children and with Elliot to pick up a propane tank. Elliot, a friend of Murray, attended the event to receive a propane tank for Moon and gift cards for food. “Getting donations and help like this is what’s keeping me helping another family and my kids and my husband eat every day,” she said. “The gift cards we put them together and say this is a couple dinners for the next couple nights, this could be breakfast that morning or lunch for the kids to take to school.” She said there are two children in her house who are autistic so the Walmart gift cards help them buy clothing she noted.\\xa0 “Propane is a big thing because (Moon and her children) are out in their trailer so it helps keep them warm,” she added. Propane tanks and donations were given away behind the Chico Mall in the Kohl’s parking lot on Thursday from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.',\n",
       " 'Paradise Police and Fire departments, as well as the Butte County Sheriff’s Office and Cal Fire, fielded calls from terrified residents first in the path of the smoke, and then in the flames. Last week, Cal Fire released two hours of their recordings, with over 1,300 additional calls to come at a later date. Together, the story they tell recreates just a sliver of that morning’s panic and confusion. Throughout it all, just two communications operators and a fire captain handled hundreds of calls calmly and quickly, with limited resources, in a rapidly changing situation. Below are some of the calls that stood out. In the first call released, a woman driving from Chico to Paradise calls and asks if she should be worried. “Should I turn around, or…?” she asks. The operator tells her there is a fire in the Jarbo Gap area, but nothing in Paradise.—A moment later, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office calls to say it’s hearing reports that the fire may be moving toward the Concow area. The staff person asks if evacuations should be ordered. “I don’t have information on that,” the operator says. “It is big. It is moving. They said rapid rate of spread.” The Chico Fire Department reports that it’s getting “all kinds of 911s.” The operator says the fire is in the Pulga area around Highway 70 heading west and that it is “fairly large.” The Chico Fire Department staff person says that callers are reporting smoke between Forest Ranch and Paradise. The operator says the column of smoke is blowing in that direction. “Unless they see an actual fire, it’s probably the smoke from that,” the operator tells them.—One minute later, the official order to evacuate Pulga is given. A woman calls from her home on Honey Run Road. She can see orange smoke across the sky. The operator tells her the fire is only in Concow, and it’s probably just the sunrise behind the smoke that she sees. A woman by the name of Louise calls — she’s not even dressed for the day yet and the fire is already moving through her yard and into her neighbor’s. Her location is redacted. The operator encourages her to get out, to evacuate while she still can. “There might not be engines that make it to that area though, so if you feel threatened, you need to get out, OK?” the operator tells her. “I gotta go!” she says, panicking. “You need to get out of there, OK?” he asks. The call cuts out. The first call about a downed power line on Skyway is reported. Ten minutes later, a woman who works at the Paradise Unified School District calls to say one of their school buses is being blocked by it, but she’s advised that it will be “a while” before anyone can send help.—Multiple calls come in for fires in the canyon. Hundreds of residents in Paradise can see flames across the canyon in Concow, and the town is now directly in the path of a large column of smoke. A woman who lives on Lowry Lane on the west side of Paradise calls, sobbing. “It’s just getting big by the second. It’s like … my whole backyard is smoking, it’s coming up to my house!” she tells them. She says she’ll be waiting on nearby Pentz Road for help to arrive. “Ma’am, we have engines coming from everywhere, OK?” the operator tells her. A minute later, a man in Concow calls. “Sir, are you reporting the fire on Concow or are you reporting a new incident?” the operator asks. “Completely engulfed!” he shouts. “Sir is there any way you can evacu–” “No!” He interrupts her. “No there’s no way, I’m surrounded by flames!” Another minute later, and a woman is calling — a spot fire has started on Jordan Hill Road, “and it’s spreading super fast.” “Ma’am, we have fires everywhere from this major fire, we’re doing everything we can and we’re getting resources mobilized,” the operator informs her. “All right, well I-I-I can’t put it out,” she stammers. “I know,” the operator says. “I know.” The Butte County Sheriff’s Office calls. Some of the office’s deputies along with a handful of evacuees are trapped in an area south of Concow, surrounded by fire. Dispatch advises them to stay in their vehicles if they are safe there. Paradise resident and former Butte County Sheriff Scott McKenzie calls. “We have major, major flames right behind (redacted) Stark Lane,” he tells the operator. He goes on to narrate exactly what he’s seeing to the operator — new spot fires starting every second on the hills across the Feather River, in Concow. Multiple calls are coming in for spot fires in Paradise. Minutes later, a spot fire has started in the fields behind a church in Paradise. The man calling says they are evacuating. “We’re trying to get people there it’s just, it’s really just blowing up very rapidly right now,” the operator tells him. “It’s overwhelming us.” Another neighbor on Lowry Lane calls, panicking about his elderly neighbors whom he can’t reach. “I need you to just evacuate,” the operator says. “Try to knock on their door and wake them up, but you need to evacuate.” “We haven’t seen anybody go over there yet! Not one person!” He starts to panic. “Sir, we have this fire everywhere, we’re doing our best to get to all of it,” the operator says. “Please just evacuate.” A slew of calls from neighboring emergency departments start to come in. They are told to direct people to the emergency information line. At 8:22 a.m., someone asks about shutting down eastbound traffic on Clark Road. “We’re just concerned about Pentz right now,” the operator says. The Butte County Sheriff’s Office calls with a transfer: A woman in Paradise named Ann says she cannot evacuate because she doesn’t have a car. The operator asks if she has neighbors who can take her to safety instead. “Yeah, but they don’t want to take my dogs!” Ann starts sobbing. “I won’t leave without my dogs!” “Ma’am you need to save your own life,” the operator tells her, firmly but gently. “I understand that your dogs are precious, but you need to save your own life, OK?” She tells Ann to leave the dogs inside with water and food, close all the doors and windows, and go with the neighbors while she can. “Ann, do you understand me?” the operator asks. The only answer is sobbing. “Ann?” “… Yes.” Ann finally says, quietly. A woman in Concow calls — she is surrounded by fire in her neighbor’s yard on Coniston Loop. The operator advises her to leave the area, but she simply says, “How? It’s all around us. Where do I go?” Suddenly, there’s a crackling and whooshing sound over the phone. “Do you hear that noise?” the caller shouts. “What?” the operator asks. After a few seconds of silence, “You there?” “That was the propane tank blowing up!” she says. Multiple calls come in reporting a spot fire at the corner of Skyway and Clark roads. Paradise resident Ashley Joyner calls; her address is redacted. “Get the kids in the car and go!” she screams at someone in the background. The fire is in her yard now and growing rapidly. “Alright Ashley, we have help on the way, OK?” the operator tells her, but the family is already evacuating. “It’s huge …” Joyner says, breathlessly. “It’s huge.” A woman calls, she’s not in the area but her son is, and she says he’s home alone; sick and paralyzed. The operator tells her she’ll pass the information on, to try to get someone up there to help him. The mother asks if they’ll go help him right away. “I don’t know that they will, ma’am,” the operator tells her, honestly. “We have fire and multiple evacuations, we’ll do the best we can.” “Well, my god! Don’t tell me that!” the mother yells. “Ma’am, that’s the best I can do.”—Approximately 26 calls came in requesting help with evacuations, or stating that they were trapped and unable to leave. Many of them were transferred to the Paradise Police Department, the Butte County Sheriff’s Office, or the California Highway Patrol. California Highway Patrol has a transfer call from a Paradise homeowner. He says his neighbor called and said his fence was on fire. “Sir, there’s fire all through Paradise,” the operator says. “We’re getting resources into the area as fast as we can.” “OK, so are there any units that could possibly respond to hopefully save my home?” the man asks. “Sir, we’re doing the best we can and we’re getting resources, like I said, into the area as fast as we can,” the operator says.—Seconds later, someone calls to report hospice patients who are stuck at a property on Carver Drive in Magalia and need help getting out. The operator says there are no evacuations currently for Magalia. A transfer call comes in, with a woman who is evacuating via the nearby bike trail reporting a fire on Moore Road behind the fire station in Paradise. The caller describes the fire as about ¼ acre in size moving at a moderate speed. “Ma’am, we have resources coming in as fast as we can, OK,” the operator says. A caller asks how close the fire is to Magalia. The operator’s advice: “I would recommend you leave. Evacuation warnings are in effect so it may not be out there yet but I would leave, if you feel threatened.” An operator receives a call about the need for air support. The operator says he is so overwhelmed by calls — receiving “over 500” — that he hasn’t been able to get to it. They coordinate to make an order for aircraft. Operators get a call from a woman who says five people are trapped by a fence somehow at Ponderosa Elementary School in Paradise, surrounded by fire on Pentz Road. The operator tells the woman she needs to do whatever she can to get out. “There’s no one to help you right now,” the operator says. “If you need to drive through a fence, then do it.” A transfer call comes in about someone unable to evacuate in Paradise. The operator asks the other agency to call Paradise Police Department for assistance.—Moments later, a woman in the employee parking lot at Feather River Hospital on Pentz Road reports a fire nearby. “Yeah there’s fires all over Paradise right now,” the operator says. “They’re doing the best they can.” A caller reports a fire above the Honey Run Covered Bridge. “I’m not aware of that spot fire but if there is fire near you, you need to go,” the operator says.–One minute later, there is another report of fire near Honey Run Road. “It’s not too big,” the caller says. “I think if you get a helicopter on it now you could probably put it out.” The Butte County Office of Emergency Services reports one ambulance on fire and another trapped near Pentz Road and Chloe Court. The operator says that resources are “pretty thin” but fire rescue is doing its best. A woman says she needs help evacuating. Her location is redacted. The operator tries for several minutes to get her to find a way out. “I’m gonna get you some help, OK,” the operator says. The woman is breathing heavily and begins coughing. There is screaming in the background. “We can’t breathe,” the woman says. “Please help us.” The operator tells her to take some blankets and leave. The woman says her family made it out onto the porch. The operator says help is coming. “Don’t leave me,” the woman says, repeating “please” and saying that she can’t breathe. The operator asks if she is out of the house. This time she says no. The woman becomes increasingly difficult to understand. She says it feels like her skin is burning. It sounds like she asks if they are going to die. The operator again asks if she is in the house, but she doesn’t respond. The call ends. An Enloe Medical Center, staff member reports two ambulances on fire at Pentz Road and Chloe Court. “We have patients on board and staff with us and they actually are on fire,” she says. “We need a unit, soon, now, like 15 minutes ago.” “I can’t give you anything else but that we will send a response,” the operator says. “That’s the best I can do.” Listen to all of the Cal Fire calls released at                      266: number of calls to Cal Fire between 7:16 a.m. to 9:22 a.m. 2 minutes: average length of call 18,804: total number of buildings destroyed 85: number of fatalities',\n",
       " 'PG&E, jolted by outrage and protests from wildfire victims and others, has jettisoned $130 million in proposed bonuses for 14,000 workers — including some management employees — according to an internal company memo. The initial proposal for the bonuses was floated in connection with PG&E’s $51.7 billion bankruptcy case, which the company initiated to help it ward off a forbidding mountain of debts and wildfire-related liabilities. Soon after that, though, PG&E was lambasted on a host of fronts for its plans to pay the bonuses, known as in corporate-speak as a short-term incentive program, or STIP. “The more I stepped back and thought about the impacts the wildfires have had on so many people outside our company, regardless of fault, the more I came to believe paying STIP in 2018 was not the right thing to do,” PG&E Interim Chief Executive Officer John Simon wrote in a memo distributed to company employees. Wildfire victims and critics of PG&E pilloried the embattled and disgraced utility for effectively ensuring that thousands of company employees would be paid $130 million ahead of any compensation for those who suffered due to the 2018 wildfire in Butte County. PG&E has now relented in the face of the public condemnation. A PG&E labor union, Engineers and Scientists of California Local 20, criticized the company’s decision to torpedo the bonus proposals. “The union believes that zeroed out STIP payments for rank and file employees do nothing to address the terrible losses of fire victims,” said John Mader, a PG&E electrical distribution engineer and president of Local 20 of the engineers and scientists union. The union warned that PG&E’s decision could hurt recruitment and employee retention efforts. “Employees’ earned compensation for the ongoing and essential work done at PG&E should not be confiscated by management as a symbolic gesture to offset the bankruptcy’s harm to creditors,” Mader said. The decision equates to a 10 percent pay cut for the 14,000 employees, according to the labor union. “We count on those payments for mortgages or rent, child care or college tuition,” said Kevin Langenberger, a senior project controls analyst with PG&E. “This is not for a fancy new car or exotic vacation. We met and exceeded individual performance goals set by the company. Yet now we are being forced to pay the price for management decisions that we had no hand in.” San Francisco-based PG&E intends to propose a new bonus program for 2019, if the bankruptcy court approves the plan. A U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing is scheduled for this week to decide numerous proposals related to the company’s Chapter 11 filing, including the 2018 bonuses that now have been scuttled. “This decision is a needless and demoralizing blow, especially when top ranking officials are getting raises and large severance packages,” Mader said. Geisha Williams, PG&E’s former chief executive officer, was sent packing in mid-January with a $2.5 million cash severance even though she was at PG&E’s helm in 2017 and 2018, two years when disastrous and deadly infernos roared through Northern California, including some blazes that have been linked to company equipment. PG&E has yet to disclose the 2018 pay packages for its top management, including the executive compensation for former CEO Williams. Payments to a top boss who presided over a disaster isn’t a new occurrence for PG&E. In 2010, PG&E caused a deadly explosion when a gas pipeline ruptured in San Bruno, a blast blamed on the utility’s shoddy maintenance, flawed record keeping and lazy oversight by the state Public Utilities Commission. Peter Darbee, who was chief executive officer before and after the blast, was enriched with a $34.8 million golden parachute, despite being in charge at the time of the explosion. “Looking at the whole picture, can we say we met the spirit of our plans for the year? Considering the impacts of the wildfires, should we be paying ourselves for our performance last year? We felt the answer was no,” Simon stated in the letter.',\n",
       " 'Every seat in the sanctuary of Paradise Alliance Church was filled including upper balcony seating for the town of Paradise first listening session, a public workshop for the community to share ideas on rebuilding the town of Paradise on Friday, Barry Long managing principal, of Urban Design Associates, led the meeting. The planning meeting began with the town receiving a check of over $23,000 from Wendy Pray on behalf of City of Woodland Hills, Utah. Pray carried in and presented the check to town council members on Paradise Alliance Church platform. She said Woodland Hills citizens organized the fundraiser and collected the donations. “We just want this community to know that we can feel their loss and we realize it’s more than the homes it’s the community. We hope that they can rebuild as quickly as possible and get back together because we know that right now they’re fractured,” Pray said.”We want them to know that we think of them.” Woodland Hills faced a fire in September, the fire came close to burning the residents’ homes and\\xa0 seeing the Paradise fire just two months later it broke their hearts, she said. Pray noted her town is in imminent danger of mudslides this spring. She added it’s been fascinating for her to listen to to the community input and envision how citizens in\\xa0 Woodland Hills might be able to do a workshop like the one today if they need it. The check presentation followed with Long addressing the variations of modular housing. After the discussion, Megan O’Hara, principal of UDA, organized facilitators for small groups of resident participants where groups broke out into a discussion gathering their input on pre-and-post fire strengths, weaknesses and the opportunities of rebuilding Paradise. In the discussion groups community members \\xa0introduced their names and where they are currently living. After introductions were made the ideas that residents shared were jotted down on easels and poster-sized paper. All of the groups were given until 11:45 a.m. to finish their discussion and map activity and then a representative of each group shared their group’s strengths, weaknesses and opportunities on stage. Paul Rickson, a retired Vietnam veteran from Paradise, attended the listening session. He has returned back to his home that is still standing but he plans to sell his house and to move outside of California. Rickson said it was OK to listen to but it will take probably 10 years until Paradise rebuilds. “I was here before the town was unincorporated and part of the county. I think it should go back to the county, there is not enough people up here to support any business,” he said.” That’s my opinion.” He talked about the town having another escape route and two lanes both directions on Skyway. He thought it was a good meeting but that they should have talked more about building codes. He added he hopes that trailer parks will not be brought back to the town because of bringing in homeless people. “(Rebuilding Paradise) could be better but it was good before,” he said At the planning meeting they didn’t go into real depth of what the town plans to do, but he will come and listen he commented. He plans on attending more of the listening sessions and apart of the rebuild effort he added. Jayne Keith,\\xa0lost her home in the fire and is from Paradise, attended the planning meeting. She said her children went to school in town and her grandchildren are going to school in Paradise. She is living in a single-wide trailer with her two dogs and cat in Rancho Tehama. All of her work was service -oriented on the ridge as she used to perform fire clearance she noted. “Up until now I’ve just been trying to survive. I knew I wanted to rebuild but I had no clue how or what to do,” she said with tears in her eyes.This is showing me some of the steps I need to take but I know there is a lot more to do, I need to learn it.” She said will be coming to all of the planning meetings because she wants to learn everything she can and talk in the different discussion groups. Keith said she likes the way the town organized the planning meeting but there she would have liked more time in her discussion group. She said she is amazed at how people are thinking along the same lines of rebuilding the town. “I’m scared because there are going to be changes but I think we all still want our small community,” she said. Keith added that the community has the same concerns and she hopes that Paradise will stay the strong community that we have been. “I think we are all in this together and I think that we will do fine as long as they keep listening to us,” she commented. She said she does not want to see big businesses come in and for the town to stay a small community. “I think we need more citizen committees to keep an eye on the fact that the things do get done and get taken care of every year,” she said.\\xa0“This (planning meeting) is showing me some of the steps that they are taking here (which) I see are good but I’m hoping that those lead to the steps that we take as property owners to rebuild,” Keith said.',\n",
       " 'PARADISE — A ’52 Chevy pickup is a pretty cool vehicle for tooling around Paradise, or anywhere else, for that point. But the paint job on Earl Adams’ model makes it awesome. It isn’t a paint job that would earn it a spot in a glossy car magazine. The once-green paint is blistered and scorched, down to bare metal in places. The rock star feature is the orange “X” on its hood, indicated it had been checked by searchers looking for bodies, after the Camp Fire roared through Paradise and across the pickup. Adams doesn’t plan to change a thing. He didn’t own the truck when the fire came to town Nov. 8, 2018. It belonged to a business associate on Nunneley Road, where Adams took cars from his shop, Carmart, at Pentz and Wagstaff Roads. The pickup’s owner wasn’t interested in selling it, but that changed after the fire came through. His insurer declared the car a total loss, and he sold it to Adams in late January. “I don’t think it was hurt as bad as he thought it was,” said Adams. He took it home, replaced the fuel lines and added a quart of oil, and it started right up. “It runs,” he said. “The gas mileage is terrible, but who cares. It has mumps and measles and stuff, but who cares.” It’s not an original ’52. There’s a later-model Chevy V-8 under the hood, and the front frame and rear axle are from a Camaro. It has power windows, power steering and power brakes. It used to have a custom rear-view mirror on the driver-side door, but that melted in the fire. “I’m going to leave that one hanging there as long as it will,” Adams said. He added a replacement mirror to make it street-legal, but “I think that’s all I’m going to do to it. I haven’t even washed it.” Well, he did add a decal to the back window, identifying it as a “CAMP FIRE SURVIVOR 11-08-18.” It’s clear how close the truck came to not being a survivor. The spaces between the boards in the truck bed are burnt, reaching almost to the gas tank mounted underneath. Adams had gone to his shop that morning to try and save the business and the cars inside. He drove his beloved white van — Vanna White — and parked it close behind the building while he tried to fight the flames. After an hour or so, he realized it was helpless, and returned to his van to flee, only to find someone had stolen the battery out of it. He climbed into another car and drove it to safety. The fire took the business, along with eight cars and 40 years worth of tools and equipment. The van survived, though it has a singe, and is a bit more tan than white now. It also has a white “X” on the windshield. “I haven’t washed that off yet either,” he said. His house survived the fire, the only one of six on a small private lane off the Skyway in northern Paradise. Adams came to Paradise in 1990. He grew up in Los Angeles, and came up to visit a friend who had moved up to the ridge. Adams’ young son at the time — he held his hand down about knee-high — had a runny nose, and he took him to a pharmacy to look for a cure. He was staring at the daunting array of options when a woman came up to him to ask if she could help. He explained the problem and she picked a product off the shelf that “worked for her grandkids.” “She didn’t work there,” Adams said. “She just saw an idiot with a kid who needed help. I thought, this might be a good place to live. This might be a good place to raise my son.” He still thinks it’s a good place to live. His purchase of a burnt-out old pickup is a sign of faith the town will rebound. As we talked Friday, chainsaws droned nearby. It’s the ubiquitous background sound in Paradise these days. Adams turned to look when the sawing was replaced by the loud, dull thud of a tree, falling to the ground. “We used to have a forest,” he said with a wry grin. “I used to have neighbors. I used to have a job. And now we all have to get used to the new normal.” “And we will.”',\n",
       " 'Kailey Elliott, a 31-year-old cancer survivor from Paradise and her husband are Camp Fire survivors with two children who lost their home, their belongings twice and are housing a family of six on their property in Chico. The couple escaped the fire and spent the first couple nights after the fire sleeping in their truck. They then moved from house to house until they saved enough money to buy a new house. Despite finally getting a roof their heads, the family’s journey since the fire has been full of challenges. Elliott went to the hospital the day after the Camp Fire for treatment because a falling tree branch that was on fire struck her back and her husband lost his truck in the fire. Her husband, who was at work the day of the fire, was hit by another car on his way home and left his car at their home in Paradise. Elliot helped evacuate four Paradise Elementary School students on the day of the fire. “I was at home (that day) and I had friends that had kids there that were on the other side of town that couldn’t get to them,” she said, adding it was scary because the power was down at the school and it was dark. “I went into each classroom and I had wet rags with me, I covered the (four children’s) faces because the smoke was so bad you couldn’t see your hand in front of you,” she said. “I filled up my truck with a bunch of kids and just said get in and we all just left.” She said her Dodge Durango’s front end melted coming down Neal Road while evacuating the elementary school students. But they soon starting getting help from the public. A Toyota Matrix was donated from Paradise’s CMA Church and about month and a half after the fire and a 20-foot trailer was donated by a friend. The couple owned property in Concow and used their GoFundMe money to replace her husband’s tools lost in the fire and generators for their Concow property. They went on a retreat to Danville and when the couple returned home on Christmas night they found everything was gone. “Somebody smashed my car, ripped out the trailer, stole everything down to our underwear,” she said.” We lost everything twice.” They stayed in a trailer in a parking lot off of the Esplanade in Chico for about two months after their belongings were stolen. However, the trailer belonged to a shop worker and they had to return it. Then the couple found a house. Now that the Elliott’s have their place they’re helping a family in need by letting them stay in a trailer in the backyard. Mandi Moon,a 39-year-old single mother and her children are living on the property. “We all went through a horrible thing and there is no reason to put somebody else out when you have the opportunity and the chance to give them something once you gain something,” Elliott said. She added they don’t have everything they need but they get what they can and come together as a team. “There’s 12 of us all together with a dog, we always figure something out,” she said. Elliott added they are taking it one day at a time. Her family along with her friend’s family of six children are living on the one-story mobile home property. Her husband has been the only person bringing in income. “He almost prefers to live in a trailer and we’ve lived off the grid for years and it wasn’t bad,” she said. “But as of now I have to have a stable home for my kids because we have no other choice.” “It has been a rough road stressing to try to pay to move in, to make sure we get power turned and how are we going to pay water,” she added. “And repaying bills again.” Before the fire, she worked as an at home care provider and owned a cleaning business but she lost her clients after the fire. She is a third time cancer survivor and says both of her children, ages 7 and 9-years-old are disabled. She also said that her husband has disabilities. “A lot of people look at me (and ask) why are you smiling? (and I say) because we made it,” she said. “We made it. There’s no reason to be upset all the time, we made it out( of the fire) and that’s what counts at this point.” Elliot said her children and the support from the community help her to keep her spirits up. “When we got robbed, I lost all of my medication. The cancer I just went through in August, I had surgery for ovarian cancer and the cancer had spread throughout my stomach,” she commented. “They stole all of my medication.” She said she has no hormones in her body and she has no idea how she’s keeping it together. “I think it’s my kids and the positive energy people (are) giving to us and saying that they’re praying for us,” she said. “And the notes I get in our mailbox, things like that has been keeping us alive and our spirits up.” The couple did not receive any funding or insurance after the fire because they were renting the house they has been living in for two months. Elliott said they are not planning to return to Paradise and the couple is currently living in their house in Chico month to month. “It’s hard on me to know that’s where my kids grew up and that’s where they recognized that was their home,” she said. “To see something like that I can’t do it. Every time I go up there I come down and I’m sick.”',\n",
       " 'Chico State University’s Department of Anthropology staff and students teamed with Gold Nugget Museum members on Saturday in full tie-back suits, gloves, shoe booties and face masks to dig through ash and debris to find the museum’s artifacts on Gold Nugget Museum grounds. Carly Whelan, a Chico State Anthropology professor, joined Anthropology Department chair and Professor of Museum Studies Georgia Fox, Rachel Hensler, a Chico State archaeology lab technician and eight student archaeologists and three students and staff member with visual Anthropology to help Museum members. “I’m glad that we are able to be able to help our neighbors in this way and to apply our skills to try to help them recover everything. It was so devastating to hear that the museum was completely destroyed,” Whelan said. “We want to help as much as we can and try to recover as many objects as possible.” Whelan helped excavate cremains prior to helping the Gold Nugget Museum search for artifacts on Saturday. She said it was emotional to find the cremated ashes to give to loved ones. “It’s been meaningful to give back to our community, the archaeology that we do is prehistoric or historic and the skills are not usually applied to contemporary findings when we learned about these opportunities we wanted to be able to help out and do whatever we can,” Whelan said. The plan was to excavate the structure from one end to the other end. They were trying to recover objects that survived the Camp Fire and the artifacts that were found were put into trays and given to the museum personnel. The Gold Nugget Museum members helped sort through the antiques to discern what is salvageable by tagging them with labels and was stored away for safekeeping. Roni Turner, Gold Nugget Museum volunteer sat at a table labeling the items found at the entrance of the museum grounds. On the table some of the items that were recovered was a cast-iron pot, a tea cup, a film reel can, a metal vase, a train set pre-World War I, and a Tonka truck. “To me (finding the artifacts) means a future, it means that we can rebuild,” Turner said. “It’s not all lost.” Randy Coy and his friend Chuck Visconte, collectors for 35 years, had a display on loan to the Gold Nugget Museum and some of the pieces were discovered by Coy in digging them up. Visconte’s collection consisted of Nonpareil Toy Co. trains and trucks, a Bing airplane toy and a standard gauge Lionel train set. Coy had Marx military trains, a Marx toy fire truck, a Tonka fire truck and a Nylint truck train. “The full top area had a Lionel train set, it has some cranes, it had fire engines, at the entry we had two fiberglass toyland soldiers that belonged to the museum as well,” Coy said.”We had a mining exhibit with mining toys, we had a character toy set from the ’40s and ’50s but mostly all Marx toys.” He had more to put into his truck the morning of the Camp Fire. Coy said he evacuated all of the Disney character toys out of the museum. “I did not display them, the climate looked interesting, I was hesitating to do it, I started evacuating toys about 40 minutes before the order to evacuate came in,” Coy said. He said it is difficult for the museum to start over because there were mining items and Native American items that are not replaceable. “The things we were loaning here and what the museum offered here it’s a part of history that is gone,” he said. “The history that those items represent is going away and the items that went away are irreplaceable.” He took a Nonpereil Toy Co. tank truck that he will return to his friend and one Marx military train car with him. The rest of the toys are left with the museum. Mark Thorp, membership & events coordinator for Paradise Ridge Chamber of Commerce said they were\\xa0 salvaged about 20 percent of the collections and exhibits items. The items found are going to be stored temporarily until out of storage GNM members Anthropology students can be preserve them. Museum staff helped Chico State staff and students know what look for when they moved through each section of the building. Michelle Rader, Gold Nugget Museum office manager said the museum lost their items’ catalogue in the fire. She said what was gathered on Saturday will be compare to what they have already listed. Some of the artifacts found are going to be on display in the Depot Museum on Black Olive Drive. A Camp Fire exhibit will be featured in the new Gold Nugget Museum with objects that survived the fire according to Rader. \\xa0The plan is to have past, present and future exhibits in the rebuilt Gold Nugget Museum she said. “The old photographs and the old documents (that were lost in the fire) are irreplaceable, irons and dolls and some were very special,” she said. “The photographs of people that founded this town is irreplaceable.” She added the museum will accept donations from people in the community but they don’t have much storage to collect them. “It would be nice to start building up a collection again that are historically important to Paradise,” she said. The Gold Nugget Museum was a whole experience between the museum and the grounds and the different programs that Gold Nugget Museum had Rader said. A modified version of Gold Nugget Days will be at Paradise Community Park on April 27. The Depot will be opening on March 1, administration and management will be working out of the Depot and they will be rebuilding the museum on the property according to Paradise Ridge Chamber of Commerce membership & events coordinator Mark Thorp.',\n",
       " 'Old Barn Kitchen, a restaurant that opened in Paradise on Clark Road before the Camp Fire is opening tomorrow at their second location in downtown Chico. Chrystal Axelsson, Old Barn Kitchen owner said since they would not be able to reopen immediately in Paradise and she and her co-owner, Toni Axelsson started looking for a second location in Chico. They say that will be hiring about 90 percent of their Paradise employees at new location. The owners have hired more employees because of the large space. The restaurant will staff about 18 employees with new hires from Chico, Paradise and Yuba City. “We didn’t think (the opening would be) this soon but we’re going with what the situation that has handed us and I think that it’s great for us to get our employees back to work here in Chico,” she said. They will train their employees for both locations and as soon as Old Barn Kitchen reopens in Paradise they will send some of their employees up the hill. “We’re really excited (to open in Chico). We’ve had a lot of people from Paradise message us and even come in here and congratulate us and say how happy they are to be able to come here and see us here and enjoy our food here,” Chrystal said.” I’m happy to be here and be able to open this quickly at a new location.” Chrystal said what makes Old Barn Kitchen unique is the scratch kitchen, high quality food. The lunch menu has been expanded and added with more food items available including shrimp scampi, chicken piccata, jambalaya with the same recipes offered as before. Vegan and gluten free options are also offered. The breakfast items that are added on the menu are salmon Hollandaise and a breakfast burrito.A family recipe that will be offered for customers at the restaurant are Icelandic pancakes. For the holidays the restaurant will feature a special menu along with their regular menu items. “We dive in to give the cultural menu options,” she said. She started designing the new location with plants and noted that there is a natural organic vibe throughout Chico. She designed the layout of the Chico restaurant with the wooden tables, the live plant walls and she bought antiques from local antique stores and had decor shipped from out of the country with the lighting fixtures from the United Kingdom. “We didn’t take anything from Paradise. I can’t bring myself to do that,” she said. “We’re reopening there, at that location, (the building) is going to get repainted, cleaned up, all that.” The timeline of reopening the Paradise location is unknown but they will reopen, according to Chrystal. She said the main concern of reopening the Paradise locations is getting water to the building in Paradise. “But there are several things that are stopping us, there is the debris clean up and FEMA is saying that it is not safe for people to be up there,” she commented. “I don’t want to be in business, operating and putting our employees and having our guests at risk when there is all this clean up going on around us.” She says they will reopen the restaurant as soon as they can. They have to wait for it is safe to open their doors in Paradise and the health department has strict regulations she added. “Unless you are able become your own water system that is not something we can do at this point,” Axelsson said. While they were working in Chico and talking with the health department they sent them the regulations and qualifications for reopening right now in Paradise she commented. “With having to become our own water system, we go through several thousand gallons of water a day,” she said. “It would be difficult for us to get the amount of water trucked up to Paradise on a daily basis that we would need.” The restaurant space in Paradise does not have room on the property for that large of a water tank she added. She said she is excited to see all of their new guests come into the Chico restaurant and to see the faces that she misses of their regular customers from Paradise. Old Barn Kitchen in Chico will showcase live music on some Saturdays for brunch and during Thursday night market from April through September the restaurant will offer a special menu on those Thursdays. The restaurant is open daily for breakfast and lunch from 7 a.m. m.- 3 p.m. The restaurant will be opening tomorrow at 7 a.m. at 301 Main Street.',\n",

       " 'PG&E had planned as far back as 2013 to replace an aging complex of transmission equipment linked to the origin area of the lethal inferno that roared though Butte County in November 2018, but has yet to initiate the upgrade, according to documents filed with state regulators. The power facilities that weren’t repaired for years stretch through Butte, Yuba and Sutter counties in Northern California and include what’s known as the Caribou-Palermo line that carries 115 kilovolts, according to official filings with the state Public Utilities Commission. The disclosures raise fresh questions about PG&E’s safety efforts as they relate to the company’s creaky complex of electricity lines and towers. “PG&E keeps telling us they are now a new company and they are changing their ways. But how can we believe them?” said state Sen. Jerry Hill, whose district includes parts of Santa Clara County. “They have said this numerous times before.” In 2010, PG&E caused a fatal gas explosion that killed eight and destroyed a San Bruno neighbor that is in Sen. Hill’s district. Federal investigators determined the explosion resulted from a disastrous combination of PG&E’s flawed record keeping, shoddy maintenance and the PUC’s lazy and ineffective oversight of PG&E. “PG&E proposes to replace six consecutive lattice-steel towers with new towers on the Caribou-Palermo power line,” former PG&E regulatory executive Brian Cherry wrote in a July 2013 advice letter to the state PUC. The towers had been knocked over in a winter storm. “Construction is tentatively scheduled to begin in the fall of 2013, or as soon as possible thereafter, with completion in winter of 2013, or as soon as possible after construction begins,” according to the advice letter. In 2016, PG&E again indicated that wide-ranging repairs were needed on the same Caribou-Palermo 115 kilo-volt transmission line, along with several other power lines in Northern California. “The purpose of this project is to replace aging facilities, address overloads and improve the reliability of electric service to customers in Butte, Yuba, and Sutter Counties,” PG&E stated in an April 2016 filing with the state PUC. The time frame for those repairs on the same line wasn’t disclosed. The complex of lines stretches 59.5 miles, according to the documents. PUC documents showed that energy officials had been warning about the fast-aging line for the better part of a decade. “In 2010 and again in 2015, the California Independent System Operator\\xa0transmission plan identified the need to improve and upgrade this system to address potential overloads and power outages that would affect customers in the service area,” according to a May 2017 PUC filing and the improvements that were again proposed for the same line. In December, PG&E revealed that it had suffered equipment failures on the Caribou-Palermo line near the origin point of the lethal Butte County inferno, also known as the Camp Fire. PG&E sought bankruptcy protection from its creditors on Jan. 29, listing $51.7 billion in debts, because it faced a forbidding mountain of debts and wildfire-related liabilities that arose from the lethal infernos that torched Northern California in 2017 and 2018. A bankruptcy judge held hearings on Wednesday regarding the case, but key issues under contention were deferred until March. “They had failed record keeping with San Bruno, and now with their electrical system, it appears to be more of the same for PG&E,” Sen. Hill said. “One of the questions is, if PG&E was given money to carry out these repairs, why didn’t they spend it? Or did they divert the money to something else?”',\n",

       " 'PG&E believes its equipment will likely be found to be the cause of the Camp Fire, an inferno that scorched Butte County in November 2018 and became the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history, the embattled power provider said Thursday. That grim prognosis — PG&E’s first official acknowledgement that it believes its equipment is likely the cause of the lethal Camp Fire — was contained in PG&E’s fourth quarter and full year financial report, which the disgraced utility released Thursday. “The company believes it is probable that its equipment will be determined to be an ignition point of the 2018 Camp Fire,” PG&E stated in an assessment that was a key component of its full-year and fourth-quarter of 2018 financial results. PG&E took a $10.5 billion pre-tax charge connected to claims arising from the Camp Fire that was recorded against the company’s financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as all of 2018. In addition, the company also took a $1 billion pre-tax charge linked to claims arising from the October 2017 infernos in the North Bay Wine Country and nearby regions. That was in addition to a previous charge of $2.5 billion for those blazes. The new charge was specifically connected to the Atlas and Cascade fires of 2017. The utility, which is already a convicted felon after being found guilty for crimes it committed before and after a fatal natural gas explosion that killed eight and destroyed a San Bruno neighborhood in 2010, pointed to four key developments for its downcast assessment of its involvement in the Camp Fire. The state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has posted coordinates on the Cal Fire web site for the Camp Fire origin that are near a PG&E transmission tower on the company’s Caribou-Palermo complex of transmission lines, stating the blaze began at 6:33 a.m. on Nov. 8, 2018. Second, at 6:15 a.m., the Caribou-Palermo line de-energized and at 6:30 a.m., a PG&E employee reported that a fire was burning near the tower. Third, later in November, PG&E observed and array of damage at the transmission tower, including broken equipment, signs of worn components and a flash mark. Fourth, at 6:45 a.m on Nov. 8, nearby PG&E facilities known the Big Bend Circuit experienced a power failure. “PG&E employees subsequently patrolling the (Big Bend Circuit) location observed damage to the pole and equipment and downed wires,” PG&E said. “Although CAL FIRE has identified this location as a potential ignition point, based on the condition of the site PG&E has not been able to determine whether the Big Bend Circuit may be a probable ignition point.” The Caribou-Palermo circuit has been taken out of service in the wake of the Butte Count firestorm, which essentially destroyed the town of Paradise. The 56-mile line was de-energized in December 2018. “Preliminary results from the enhanced inspections on this transmission line have identified some equipment conditions that require repair or replacement,” PG&E stated.',\n",

Fourth, at 6:45 a.m on Nov. 8, nearby PG&E facilities known the Big Bend Circuit experienced a power failure. “PG&E employees subsequently patrolling the (Big Bend Circuit) location observed damage to the pole and equipment and downed wires,” PG&E said. “Although CAL FIRE has identified this location as a potential ignition point, based on the condition of the site PG&E has not been able to determine whether the Big Bend Circuit may be a probable ignition point.” The Caribou-Palermo circuit has been taken out of service in the wake of the Butte Count firestorm, which essentially destroyed the town of Paradise. The 56-mile line was de-energized in December 2018. “Preliminary results from the enhanced inspections on this transmission line have identified some equipment conditions that require repair or replacement,” PG&E stated.',\n",
       " 'RED BLUFF — A pair of Antelope 4-H youth are working to assist Paradise 4-H members in getting back on their feet following the devastating Camp Fire. T.C. Drury and Catlyn Mackey, both known for community service, got approval Jan. 22 seek donations and raise money by operating food booths at local events. “This is our Emerald Star Project,” Drury said. “It’s a project that is about helping community. 4-H has taught us to give back and when we heard about the fires it just hit us that the 4-H groups in the area should be able to still do their projects. So we started this project to help them.” The goal is to make sure the Paradise youth are ready come fair time. “We’re collecting anything and everything they need so they can go to their fair in May,” Mackey said. “Clippers, blowers, whatever will help relieve the burden so they can enjoy fair. They don’t have a community so we need to be their community.” Items needed include halters, brushes, shampoo, show chains, water boots, feed, white shirts and jeans, 4-H hats, scarves and ties. Monetary donations are also welcome and checks can be made out to the Antelope 4-H. The pair have a connection to the Paradise area, as both had been talking to a Paradise breeder about their 4-H project goats prior to the fire, said Kristine Ramier, Drury’s aunt. “The goats survived the Paradise fire, but (the breeders) didn’t know for a week if they had survived,” Ramier said. “Goats eat brush, which helped them survive.” Drury visited the area after the fire. “We were able to see the destruction first hand and you would see whole neighborhoods where there was a whole street with just one house,” Drury said. “In the Pineridge 4-H there are 26 families and 24 of them lost everything.” With an initial goal of $1,000, the pair had surpassed that by Feb. 16 and were at around $1,700, said Kathy Mackey, Catlyn’s mother. They got Roper Apparel to donate white shirts for the 4-H members and Weaver Leather donated show spray. “We’re very proud of the way they have come together and to have two kids who said, even if it isn’t approved, we still want to do what we can to help,” Kathy Mackey said. The pair have reached out to several local organizations and held a number of fundraisers. Donations have come from people as far as Montana and Oregon, Mackey said. A hat from Barbara’s Custom Hats in Fort Worth, Texas will be raffled off, with the winner announced via Facebook on March 18. Anyone interested in a presentation on the project or donating can call Drury at 200-2268 or Mackey at 527-2201.',\n",

       " 'The morning of the Camp Fire, former Paradise resident Ashley Joyner was at home, watching over seven children ranging in age from 17 to just one year old. Two of the children were her own and five belonged to her friend, who she regularly helped by babysitting. “That morning, I went and dropped my kids off at the (school) bus stop. There was no sign of a fire,” Joyner said. “Finally the bus showed up, and not even 15-20 minutes later, I’m getting phone calls from the school, telling me I got to go pick up the kids.” Joyner said as soon as she stepped outside, “it looked like a volcano had erupted.” What happened next was similar to so many other stories from that terrible day, but Joyner’s story was — at least partially — captured by her emotional 911 call that morning. https://www.chicoer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/11-08-18-08.35.57-Phones-02-TEL-POS-2_Redacted.wav Joyner’s call was one of 266 calls recently released by Cal Fire, out of 1,300 total. However, she was one of the few callers to give her full name on that hectic and traumatic morning. “As soon as I heard it, I broke down, I started crying,” Joyner said. “I didn’t really remember what all I had said until I actually listened to the phone call, and it just brought everything back. I mean, the fear and just the emotions … it was just all crazy.” By 8:35 a.m., a spot fire had started on her property near Clark Road and the Skyway and the flames were growing rapidly. Joyner says she only had minutes to evacuate the seven children and herself into a single car that wouldn’t safely fit all of them. She called 911 as the fire spread on her property, and got the California Highway Patrol, who promptly transferred her to Cal Fire’s dispatch center in Oroville. “I was hollering for the oldest, his name was Zach,” Joyner recalled. “I was sitting outside trying to water it, to buy us a little time to get all the kids out of the house and into the car.” All seven children were in the car when the mother of the children she was taking care of showed up, Joyner said. “She was down in Oroville working, and I was on the phone with her throughout the whole morning telling her, ‘Hey you need to get up here.’” As soon as her friend arrived, Joyner said they had to leave. “There was no time to gather anything, and she was all, ‘Well I need this, I need that,’ and no, there was no time.” Joyner and her children escaped down the hill to Chico with nothing but the clothes on their backs, watching their house succumb to the fire as they drove away. The drive to safety down the hill would take a full eight hours. “My kids they were crying, scared, didn’t know what was going on,” Joyner said. “We looked behind us, and we saw our place go up in flames. We knew before Cal Fire told us. We knew beforehand that it was gone, because we watched it go up.” In the immediate aftermath of the fire, the family stayed in a motel for a few weeks, but eventually needed to find new housing and were faced with living in their car. “I came to a friend’s house, and I just broke down crying telling her, we’re going to end up living out of our car or in a tent,” Joyner said. “I was gonna sleep in my car or something and I was gonna have my kids stay with friends.” At the same time, Joyner’s husband lost his job after taking too much time off after the fire. So their friend took them in, at her own home in Oroville, and that’s where they’ve been ever since. But soon, she said, the family may consider a move to rural Wisconsin, where Joyner’s husband’s family lives. Her husband also found a new job, working as a forklift operator. “We’re looking, possibly. We want to wait until school is out; we want the kids to finish up,” she said.           Joyner said her daughter, who is 6, is doing OK, mostly concerned with the loss of her toys and not being able to see her friends. “Her number one thing is her friends that she left behind and (I tell her) ‘Honey, your friends are scattered everywhere right now,” Joyner said. “She wants to go home, and I keep telling her we can’t, we don’t have a home to go to.” Her son, who is 11, is having a rougher time of it. “We tried getting him into counseling through the school but he refuses to do it; he doesn’t want to talk about it. He doesn’t want to talk to nobody,” Joyner said. “He wakes up crying at night, and the doctor said he’s probably got a little bit of PTSD, which I kind of figured he did. The first week he woke up constantly looking out the windows, asking if the fire was coming.” For her own part, Joyner said hearing the 911 call brought back a flood of emotional memories. “I never thought I would ever hear it,” she said. “It brought back so much, so many emotions that I didn’t really know how to deal with it at the moment.” Joyner said she went outside and cried after hearing her panicked voice in the call from that morning. She said she tries hard not to be emotional, especially around her children. “I’ve been actually thinking about trying to find somebody that I can actually talk to,” Joyner said. “I don’t want them to see me break down.”',\n",
