## Questions

### I. 

- What's the topic of your project? 
- What question(s) will you attempt to answer or what problems will you attempt to solve? 
- Why and to whom are these meaningful?
</br>
1. The topic of the project is climate change and its relationship with population and demographics. 

2. We attempt to solve the following questions.

	* How does climate affect cost of living, population, and demographics (age, race, level of education). 
	
	* How has climate change affected these features over time?
	
3. This can be meaningful to realtors/construction managers. For example, realtors/construction managers could forecast how cost of living may change in relation to impending 
climate change and decide to build houses in an area with “bad” climate change that may change in the future.  

### II.

What data source(s) will your team use? Briefly describe each data source and explain how you think you will use it. Provide a link for each data source. This is a check to make sure that there is actually data available for your topic. If you ultimately decide not to use some of the data sources, or find additional data sources later, that's okay.
</br>
The first source comes from the US Department of Commerce, which contains data on climate change since the late 19th century. We may want to use data from this source to track the effects of climate change with regards to cost of living, population,  and various demographics. The other source is the US Census Bureau, which contains census data regarding the overall US population. We will use this data set to obtain some of the information we require such as cost of living, population, and demographics.

### III.

- What makes your project challenging? Consider that you will have about 6 weeks to work on the project. 
- What skills from STA 141A-B or other statistics classes do you expect to use on the project?
</br>
1. This project will be challenging because we need to use multiple datasets to answer various questions. One aspect that may be difficult is merging the climate and demographic datasets. In order to merge multiple datasets together, it will be important to standardize the format of the data sets. 
2. We can use exploratory data analysis skills that we learned from STA 141A to create maps or graphics visualizing the data. We will need to learn how to perform EDA using Python and possibly machine learning models in this class. We can use our knowledge of regression methods from STA 108 to build additionally statistical models on our data.
