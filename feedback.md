> How has climate change affected these features over time?

The immediate problem you face is how to define and quantify "climate change".
There are also many confounding factors that could influence cost of living,
population, and demographics. It's unlikely you will be able to get data to
control for all of the confounding factors.

Another possible problem: has climate change already had a major impact on
ordinary people? It seems like it may be just starting to affect ordinary
people. So you might have a hard time finding any kind of historical trend that
you can realistically and conclusively attribute to climate change.

In addition, since we are statisticians working on observational data, we can't
infer any kind of causation. The best we can do is identify trends and
patterns.

> The other source is the US Census Bureau ...

Which of their data sources do you actually intend to use? What kinds of data
about climate change does the Dept of Commerce actually provide?

The Census is only taken every 10 years, so will you have enough data to
actually detect changes?

> US Department of Commerce: https://www.noaa.gov/

Note that this is not the US Department of Commerce

I'm concerned that your project doesn't have a clear focus and the few
questions you posed in the proposal may be difficult or impossible to answer
conclusively with the datasets you're suggesting (or any public dataset).

So I recommend that you rethink your project topic, either making your
questions more specific and concrete (with data sources that can actually help
you reach answers) or else changing topics. Come chat with me or a TA in office
hours if you find yourselves struggling with this.
